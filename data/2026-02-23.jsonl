Implementation and evaluation study of cross-boundary agent orchestration for Gemini Enterprise UI", "summary": "Enterprise conversational UIs increasingly need to orchestrate heterogeneous backend agents and tools across project and account boundaries in a secure and reproducible way. Starting from Gemini Enterprise Agent-to-Agent (A2A) invocation, we implement an A2A Hub orchestrator on Cloud Run that routes queries to four paths: a public A2A agent deployed in a different project, an IAM-protected Cloud Run A2A agent in a different account, a retrieval-augmented generation path combining Discovery Engine and Vertex AI Search with direct retrieval of source text from Google Cloud Storage, and a general question answering path via Vertex AI. We show that practical interoperability is governed not only by protocol compliance but also by Gemini Enterprise UI constraints and boundary-dependent authentication. Real UI requests arrive as text-only inputs and include empty accepted output mode lists, so mixing structured data into JSON-RPC responses can trigger UI errors. To address this, we enforce a text-only compatibility mode on the JSON-RPC endpoint while separating structured outputs and debugging signals into a REST tool API. On a four-query benchmark spanning expense policy, project management assistance, general knowledge, and incident response deadline extraction, we confirm deterministic routing and stable UI responses. For the retrieval path, granting storage object read permissions enables evidence-backed extraction of the fifteen minute deadline. All experiments are reproducible using the repository snapshot tagged a2a-hub-gemini-ui-stable-paper."}

However, the limited on-chip memory of these accelerators forces inference runtimes to swap model segments between host and accelerator memory, substantially inflating latency. While collaborative processing by partitioning the model processing between CPU and accelerator resources can reduce accelerator memory pressure and latency, naive partitioning may worsen end-to-end latency by either shifting excessive computation to the CPU or failing to sufficiently curb swapping, a problem that is further amplified in multi-tenant and dynamic environments.\n  To address these issues, we present SwapLess, a system for adaptive, multi-tenant TPU-CPU collaborative inference for memory-constrained Edge TPUs. SwapLess utilizes an analytic queueing model that captures partition-dependent CPU/TPU service times as well as inter- and intra-model swapping overheads across different workload mixes and request rates. Using this model, SwapLess continuously adjusts both the partition point and CPU core allocation online to minimize end-to-end response time with low decision overhead. An implementation on Edge TPU-equipped platforms demonstrates that SwapLess reduces mean latency by up to 63.8% for single-tenant workloads and up to 77.4% for multi-tenant workloads relative to the default Edge TPU compiler."}

A central challenge is the Access Point Selection (APS) problem, which seeks to determine the subset of serving Access Points (APs) for each User Equipment (UE) that can satisfy UEs' Spectral Efficiency (SE) requirements while minimizing network power consumption. We introduce APS-GNN, a scalable distributed multi-agent learning framework that decomposes APS into agents operating at the granularity of individual AP-UE connections. Agents coordinate via local observation exchange over a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture and share parameters to reuse their knowledge and experience. APS-GNN adopts a constrained reinforcement learning approach to provide agents with explicit observability of APS' conflicting objectives, treating SE satisfaction as a cost and power reduction as a reward. Both signals are defined locally, facilitating effective credit assignment and scalable coordination in large networks. To further improve training stability and exploration efficiency, the policy is initialized via supervised imitation learning from a heuristic APS baseline. We develop a realistic CFmMIMO simulator and demonstrate that APS-GNN delivers the target SE while activating 50-70% fewer APs than heuristic and centralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) baselines in different evaluation scenarios. Moreover, APS-GNN achieves one to two orders of magnitude lower inference latency than centralized MARL approaches due to its fully parallel and distributed execution. These results establish APS-GNN as a practical and scalable solution for APS in large-scale CFmMIMO networks."}

In such environments, communication can no longer be understood solely as delivering bits or even preserving semantic meaning. Even when two agents interpret the same information correctly, they may still behave inconsistently if their internal reasoning processes evolve differently. We refer to this emerging challenge as belief divergence. This article introduces reasoning native agentic communication, a new paradigm in which communication is explicitly designed to address belief divergence rather than merely transmitting representations. Instead of triggering transmissions based only on channel conditions or data relevance, the proposed framework activates communication according to predicted misalignment in agents internal belief states. We present a reasoning native architecture that augments the conventional communication stack with a coordination plane grounded in a shared knowledge structure and bounded belief modeling. Through enabling mechanisms and representative multi agent scenarios, we illustrate how such an approach can prevent coordination drift and maintain coherent behavior across heterogeneous systems. By reframing communication as a regulator of distributed reasoning, reasoning native agentic communication enables 6G networks to act as an active harmonizer of autonomous intelligence."}

However, when we apply these methods to artificial intelligence initiatives -- especially those involving large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems -- the results can be systematically misleading. This paper shares an evidence-backed analysis of five foundational assumptions we often make during T-shirt sizing. While these assumptions usually hold true for traditional software, they tend to fail in AI contexts: (1) linear effort scaling, (2) repeatability from prior experience, (3) effort-duration fungibility, (4) task decomposability, and (5) deterministic completion criteria. Drawing on recent research into multi-agent system failures, scaling principles, and the inherent unreliability of multi-turn conversations, we show how AI development breaks these rules. We see this through non-linear performance jumps, complex interaction surfaces, and \"tight coupling\" where a small change in data cascades through the entire stack. To help teams navigate this, we propose Checkpoint Sizing: a more human-centric, iterative approach that uses explicit decision gates where scope and feasibility are reassessed based on what we learn during development, rather than what we assumed at the start. This paper is intended for engineering managers, technical leads, and product owners responsible for planning and delivering AI initiatives."}

All results herein achieve polylogarithmic depth, with high probability (whp); the focus of this paper is on minimizing the work, which varies across results.\n  Our first result is the first parallel batch-dynamic algorithm to maintain an asymptotically optimal orientation with asymptotically optimal expected work bounds, in an amortized sense, improving over the prior best work bounds of Liu et al.~[SPAA~'22] by a logarithmic factor.\n  Our second result is a $O(c \\log n)$ orientation algorithm with expected worst-case $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ work per edge update, where $c$ is a known upper-bound on the arboricity of the graph.

However, most existing platforms exhibit rigid architectures with limited configurability, restricting their adaptability to heterogeneous workloads and diverse design objectives. To address these limitations, we present Flexi-NeurA -- a parameterizable neuromorphic accelerator (core) that unifies configurability, flexibility, and efficiency. Flexi-NeurA allows users to customize neuron models, network structures, and precision settings at design time. By pairing these design-time configurability and flexibility features with a time-multiplexed and event-driven processing approach, Flexi-NeurA substantially reduces the required hardware resources and total power while preserving high efficiency and low inference latency. Complementing this, we introduce Flex-plorer, a heuristic-guided design-space exploration (DSE) tool that determines cost-effective fixed-point precisions for critical parameters -- such as decay factors, synaptic weights, and membrane potentials -- based on user-defined trade-offs between accuracy and resource usage. Based on the configuration selected through the Flex-plorer process, RTL code is configured to match the specified design. Comprehensive evaluations across MNIST, SHD, and DVS benchmarks demonstrate that the Flexi-NeurA and Flex-plorer co-framework achieves substantial improvements in accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency. A three-layer 256--128--10 fully connected network with LIF neurons mapped onto two processing cores achieves 97.23% accuracy on MNIST with 1.1~ms inference latency, utilizing only 1,623 logic cells, 7 BRAMs, and 111~mW of total power -- establishing Flexi-NeurA as a scalable, edge-ready neuromorphic platform."}

LLMs often produce confident descriptions of what the code looks like it should do (intent), while missing subtle edge cases or logic changes that define what it actually does (behavior). We present a mutation-based evaluation methodology that directly tests whether a summary truly matches the code's logic. Our approach generates a summary, injects a targeted mutation into the code, and checks if the LLM updates its summary to reflect the new behavior. We validate it through three experiments totalling 624 mutation-summary evaluations across 62 programs. First, on 12 controlled synthetic programs with 324 mutations varying in type (statement, value, decision) and location (beginning, middle, end). We find that summary accuracy decreases sharply with complexity from 76.5% for single functions to 17.3% for multi-threaded systems, while mutation type and location exhibit weaker effects. Second, testing 150 mutated samples on 50 human-written programs from the Less Basic Python Problems (LBPP) dataset confirms the same failure patterns persist as models often describe algorithmic intent rather than actual mutated behavior with a summary accuracy rate of 49.3%. Furthermore, while a comparison between GPT-4 and GPT-5.2 shows a substantial performance leap (from 49.3% to 85.3%) and an improved ability to identify mutations as \"bugs\", both models continue to struggle with distinguishing implementation details from standard algorithmic patterns. This work establishes mutation analysis as a systematic approach for assessing whether LLM-generated summaries reflect program behavior rather than superficial textual patterns."}

Existing GPU memory estimators span three paradigms -- analytical models, CPU-side libraries, and ML-based estimators -- each with distinct limitations: dependence on detailed model specifications, intrusive integration, poor generalization, and varying latency overhead. GPU heterogeneity further complicates estimation, as identical tasks can exhibit markedly different memory footprints across hardware generations. GPU utilization remains comparatively understudied, further complicated by the non-additive nature of utilization metrics and hardware sensitivity. We conduct a systematic analysis of representative estimators from each paradigm -- Horus, PyTorch FakeTensor, and our lightweight ML-based estimator -- evaluating accuracy, generalizability, and practical overhead. We construct a synthetic dataset spanning MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers with controlled architectural variations, and train MLP- and Transformer-based estimators for memory prediction. We further experiment with utilization estimation on the same dataset. Our evaluation reveals key tradeoffs and validates estimators against real-world unseen models.

In this paper, we propose two noise reduction methods for Digital Visible Light Communication (DVLC) systems. The first method exploits the periodic nature of interference caused by AC-powered-line illumination and reduces interference by subtracting sampled noise waveforms from the received signal. Second, inspired by Active Noise Control (ANC) techniques, an additional photodiode is introduced for noise reception, and subtraction circuits are employed to attenuate noise in real time.

However, this reduction requires every agent to act at every time step; when some agents are idle, the mean action is simply undefined. Addressing asynchrony therefore requires a different summary statistic -- one that remains defined regardless of which agents act. The population distribution $μ\\in Δ(\\mathcal{O})$ -- the fraction of agents at each observation -- satisfies this requirement: its dimension is independent of $N$, and under exchangeability it fully determines each agent's reward and transition. Existing MF-RL theory, however, is built on the mean action and does not extend to $μ$. We therefore construct the Temporal Mean Field (TMF) framework around the population distribution $μ$ from scratch, covering the full spectrum from fully synchronous to purely sequential decision-making within a single theory. We prove existence and uniqueness of TMF equilibria, establish an $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ finite-population approximation bound that holds regardless of how many agents act per step, and prove convergence of a policy gradient algorithm (TMF-PG) to the unique equilibrium. Experiments on a resource selection game and a dynamic queueing game confirm that TMF-PG achieves near-identical performance whether one agent or all $N$ act per step, with approximation error decaying at the predicted $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ rate."}

With these aspects in mind, many models have been proposed in literature. Furthermore, many information dissemination approaches are proposed. However, the lack of a model that can manage traffic incidents completely inspires this work. This paper details how and when a message needs to be generated and relayed so that the incidents can be reported and managed in a timely manner. This paper addresses this challenge by providing a traffic incident management model to manage several traffic incidents efficiently. Additionally, we simulate this model using the VEINS simulator with vehicles, RSUs, and a TA. From the experiments, we measure the average number of transmissions required for reporting a single traffic incident while varying the vehicle density and relaying considerations. We consider two types of relaying. In one series of experiments, messages from regular vehicles and RSUs are relayed up to four hops. In another series of experiments, messages from the regular vehicles and RSUs are relayed until their generation time reaches sixty seconds. Additionally, messages from the official vehicles are relayed when they approach an incident or when the incident is cleared. Results from the simulations show that more vehicles are informed with four-hop relaying than sixty-second relaying in both cases."}

In this study, we present the first empirical analysis to answer these questions in the domain of TypeScript projects.

This paper presents a technical solution for heterogeneous mixed training in AMD-NVIDIA environments. We first adopt a compatibility-oriented approach based on CPU-Forwarding Communication, with differentiated communication back-end selection across parallel groups and multi-NIC parallel data transfer. To achieve higher performance, we further propose another Device-Direct Communication approach, integrating a CPU-offloading P2P mechanism to enable direct cross-vendor GPU data transfer without host-memory staging. Experiments on LLaMA-8B and Qwen2-7B demonstrate that the proposed Device-Direct Communication approach achieves up to 98% of the throughput of an NVIDIA homogeneous system, while preserving training stability and correctness."}

As a result, the energy and carbon characteristics of small language models (SLMs) during test generation remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work introduces the DeCEAT framework, which systematically evaluates the environmental and performance trade-offs of SLMs using the HumanEval benchmark and adaptive prompt variants (based on the Anthropic template). The framework quantifies emission and time-aware behavior under controlled conditions, with CodeCarbon measuring energy consumption and carbon emissions, and unit test coverage assessing the quality of generated tests. Our results show that different SLMs exhibit distinct sustainability strengths: some prioritize lower energy use and faster execution, while others maintain higher stability or accuracy under carbon constraints. These findings demonstrate that sustainability in the generation of SLM-driven tests is multidimensional and strongly shaped by prompt design. This work provides a focused sustainability evaluation framework specifically tailored to automated SLM-based test generation, clarifying how prompt structure and model choice jointly influence environmental and performance outcomes."}

The Version of Record is available online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2026.108414", "summary": "A growing number of critical workflow applications leverage a streamlined edge-hub-cloud architecture, which diverges from the conventional edge computing paradigm. An edge device, in collaboration with a hub device and a cloud server, often suffices for their reliable and efficient execution. However, task allocation in this streamlined architecture is challenging due to device limitations and diverse operating conditions. Given the inherent criticality of such workflow applications, where reliability and latency are vital yet conflicting objectives, an exact task allocation approach is typically required to ensure optimal solutions. As no existing method holistically addresses these issues, we propose an exact multi-objective task allocation framework to jointly optimize the overall reliability and latency of a workflow application in the specific edge-hub-cloud architecture. We present a comprehensive binary integer linear programming formulation that considers the relative importance of each objective. It incorporates time redundancy techniques, while accounting for crucial constraints often overlooked in related studies. We evaluate our approach using a relevant real-world workflow application, as well as synthetic workflows varying in structure, size, and criticality. In the real-world application, our method achieved average improvements of 84.19% in reliability and 49.81% in latency over baseline strategies, across relevant objective trade-offs. Overall, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach across diverse workflow applications for the considered system architecture, highlighting its practicality with runtimes averaging between 0.03 and 50.94 seconds across all examined workflows."}

The InnoRegioChallenge project investigated whether a virtual test and integration environment can reproduce electronic control unit (ECU) behavior early enough to run real software binaries before physical hardware exists. We report a prototype that generates instruction-accurate processor models in SystemC/TLM~2.0 using an agentic, feedback-driven workflow coupled to a reference simulator via the GNU Debugger (GDB). The results indicate that the most critical technical risk -- CPU behavioral fidelity -- can be reduced through automated differential testing and iterative model correction. We summarize the architecture, the agentic modeling loop, and project outcomes, and we extrapolate plausible technical details consistent with the reported qualitative findings. While cloud-scale deployment and full toolchain integration remain future work, the prototype demonstrates a viable shift-left path for virtual ECU twins, enabling reproducible tests, non-intrusive tracing, and fault-injection campaigns aligned with safety standards."}

First introduced in the seminal paper by Naor and Stockmeyer [STOC 1993], these are graph problems that can be described by listing a finite set of valid local neighborhoods. This seemingly simple definition strikes a careful balance between two objectives: they are a family of problems that is broad enough so that it captures numerous problems that are of interest to researchers working in this field, yet restrictive enough so that it is possible to prove strong theorems that hold for all LCL problems. In particular, the distributed complexity landscape of LCL problems is now very well understood.\n  In this work we show that the family of LCL problems is extremely robust to variations. We present a very restricted family of locally checkable problems (essentially, the \"node-edge checkable\" formalism familiar from round elimination, restricted to regular unlabeled graphs); most importantly, such problems cannot directly refer to e.g. the existence of short cycles. We show that one can translate between the two formalisms (there are local reductions in both directions that only need access to a symmetry-breaking oracle, and hence the overhead is at most an additive $O(\\log^* n)$ rounds in the LOCAL model)."}

One of these aspects is how individuals perceive themselves regarding their work, i.e., their work identity, and the processes they perform to form, adapt and reject these identities, i.e., identity work. Existent studies provide evidence of such identity work of software professionals triggered by the adoption of GenAI, however they do not consider differences among diverse roles, such as developers and testers. In this paper, we argue the need for considering the role as a factor defining the identity work of software professionals. To support our claim, we review some studies regarding different roles and also recent studies on how to adopt GenAI in software engineering. Then, we propose a research agenda to better understand how the role influences identity work of software professionals triggered by the adoption of GenAI, and, based on that, to propose new artifacts to support this adoption. We also discuss the potential implications for practice of the results to be obtained."}

In the context of cloud-native applications deployed across the cloud-edge continuum, this challenge translates into identifying energy-efficient deployment strategies that consider not only the computational demands of application components but also the environmental impact of the nodes on which they are executed. Generating deployment plans that account for these dynamic factors is non-trivial, due to fluctuations in application behaviour and variations in the carbon intensity of infrastructure nodes. In this paper, we present an approach for the automatic generation of deployment plans guided by green constraints. These constraints are derived from a continuous analysis of energy consumption patterns, inter-component communication, and the environmental characteristics of the underlying infrastructure. This paper introduces a methodology and architecture for the generation of a set of green-aware constraints that inform the scheduler to produce environmentally friendly deployment plans. We demonstrate how these constraints can be automatically learned and updated over time using monitoring data, enabling adaptive, energy-aware orchestration. The proposed approach is validated through realistic deployment scenarios of a cloud-native application, showcasing its effectiveness in reducing energy usage and associated emissions."}

Despite growing interest, the interview competence of LLMs in conversational requirements elicitation remains fully underexplored. Existing evaluations often depend on a few scenarios, real user interaction, and subjective human scoring, which hinders systematic and quantitative comparison. To address these challenges, we propose ReqElicitGym, an interactive and automatic evaluation environment for assessing interview competence in conversational requirements elicitation. Specifically, ReqElicitGym introduces a new evaluation dataset and designs both an interactive oracle user and a task evaluator. The dataset contains 101 website requirements elicitation scenarios spanning 10 application types. Both the oracle user and the task evaluator achieve high agreement with real users and expert judgment. Using our ReqElicitGym, any automated conversational requirements elicitation approach (e.g., LLM-based agents) can be evaluated in a reproducible and quantitative manner through interaction with the environment. Based on our ReqElicitGym, we conduct a systematic empirical study on seven representative LLMs, and the results show that current LLMs still exhibit limited interview competence in uncovering implicit requirements. Particularly, they elicit less than half of the users' implicit requirements, and their effective elicitation questions often emerge in later turns of the dialogue. Besides, we found LLMs can elicit interaction and content implicit requirements, but consistently struggle with style-related requirements. We believe ReqElicitGym will facilitate the evaluation and development of automated conversational requirements elicitation."}

However, most benchmarks for LLM-based proof automation are drawn from mathematics in the Mathlib ecosystem, whereas proofs in software verification are developed inside definition-rich codebases with substantial project-specific libraries. We introduce VeriSoftBench, a benchmark of 500 Lean 4 proof obligations drawn from open-source formal-methods developments and packaged to preserve realistic repository context and cross-file dependencies. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs and specialized provers yields three observations. First, provers tuned for Mathlib-style mathematics transfer poorly to this repository-centric setting. Second, success is strongly correlated with transitive repository dependence: tasks whose proofs draw on large, multi-hop dependency closures are less likely to be solved. Third, providing curated context restricted to a proof's dependency closure improves performance relative to exposing the full repository, but nevertheless leaves substantial room for improvement. Our benchmark and evaluation suite are released at https://github.com/utopia-group/VeriSoftBench."}

Standards such as ISO/IEC 25059 provide a quality model, but they lack practical and statistically robust methods for assessing functional correctness. This paper proposes and evaluates the Statistical Confidence in Functional Correctness (SCFC) approach, which seeks to fill this gap by connecting business requirements to a measure of statistical confidence that considers both the model's average performance and its variability. The approach consists of four steps: defining quantitative specification limits, performing stratified and probabilistic sampling, applying bootstrapping to estimate a confidence interval for the performance metric, and calculating a capability index as a final indicator. The approach was evaluated through a case study on two real-world AI systems in industry involving interviews with AI experts. Valuable insights were collected from the experts regarding the utility, ease of use, and intention to adopt the methodology in practical scenarios. We conclude that the proposed approach is a feasible and valuable way to operationalize the assessment of functional correctness, moving the evaluation from a point estimate to a statement of statistical confidence."}

We build a Docker measurement pipeline and apply it to a stratified sample of 2,000 GitHub repositories that contained a Dockerfile.

After modifying infrastructure configurations, we raise bitwise reproducibility by 18.6%, but 78.7% of buildable Dockerfiles remain non-reproducible. We analyze the root causes of the remaining differences, and find that beyond timestamps and metadata, developer-controlled choices such as uncleaned caches, logs, documentation, and floating versions are dominant causes of non-reproducibility. We derive concrete Dockerfile guidelines from these patterns and discuss how they can inform future linters and Continuous Integration (CI) checks for reproducible containers."}
