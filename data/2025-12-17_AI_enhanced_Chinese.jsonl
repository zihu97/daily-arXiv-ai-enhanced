Architecture-level power models are necessary for early power optimization and design space exploration. However, classical analytical architecture-level power models (e.g., McPAT) suffer from significant inaccuracies. Emerging machine learning (ML)-based power models, despite their superior accuracy in research papers, are not widely adopted in the industry. In this work, we point out three inherent limitations of ML-based power models: unreliability, limited interpretability, and difficulty in usage. This work proposes a new analytical power modeling framework named ReadyPower, which is ready-for-use by being reliable, interpretable, and handy. We observe that the root cause of the low accuracy of classical analytical power models is the discrepancies between the real processor implementation and the processor's analytical model. To bridge the discrepancies, we introduce architecture-level, implementation-level, and technology-level parameters into the widely adopted McPAT analytical model to build ReadyPower. The parameters at three different levels are decided in different ways. In our experiment, averaged across different training scenarios, ReadyPower achieves >20% lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and >0.2 higher correlation coefficient R compared with the ML-based baselines, on both BOOM and XiangShan CPU architectures.baselines, on both BOOM and XiangShan CPU architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReadyPower\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6027\u529f\u8017\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u53c2\u6570\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u51c6\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5de5\u4e1a\u754c\u91c7\u7eb3\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5728McPAT\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u67b6\u6784\u7ea7\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea7\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7ea7\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6613\u7528\u7684ReadyPower\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728BOOM\u548cXiangShan\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\uff0cReadyPower\u5e73\u5747MAPE\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8520%\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570R\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d850.2\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eML\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "ReadyPower\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5904\u7406\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Wafer-scale chips (WSCs) provide high computation power and die-to-die (D2D) bandwidth but face a unique trade-off between on-chip memory and compute resources due to limited wafer area. Therefore, tensor parallelism strategies for wafer should leverage communication advantages while maintaining memory efficiency to maximize WSC performance. However, existing approaches fail to address these challenges.\n  To address these challenges, we propose the tensor stream partition paradigm (TSPP), which reveals an opportunity to leverage WSCs' abundant communication bandwidth to alleviate stringent on-chip memory constraints. However, the 2D mesh topology of WSCs lacks long-distance and flexible interconnects, leading to three challenges: 1) severe tail latency, 2) prohibitive D2D traffic contention, and 3) intractable search time for optimal design.\n  We present TEMP, a framework for LLM training on WSCs that leverages topology-aware tensor-stream partition, traffic-conscious mapping, and dual-level wafer solving to overcome hardware constraints and parallelism challenges. These integrated approaches optimize memory efficiency and throughput, unlocking TSPP's full potential on WSCs.

Sparse attention methods alleviate this by skipping low-relevance token pairs. However, current approaches lack practicality due to the heavy expense of added sparsity predictor, which severely drops their hardware efficiency.\n  This paper advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by proposing a bit-serial enable stage-fusion (BSF) mechanism, which eliminates the need for a separate predictor. However, it faces key challenges: 1) Inaccurate bit-sliced sparsity speculation leads to incorrect pruning; 2) Hardware under-utilization due to fine-grained and imbalanced bit-level workloads. 3) Tiling difficulty caused by the row-wise dependency in sparsity pruning criteria.\n  We propose PADE, a predictor-free algorithm-hardware co-design for dynamic sparse attention acceleration. PADE features three key innovations: 1) Bit-wise uncertainty interval-enabled guard filtering (BUI-GF) strategy to accurately identify trivial tokens during each bit round; 2) Bidirectional sparsity-based out-of-order execution (BS-OOE) to improve hardware utilization; 3) Interleaving-based sparsity-tiled attention (ISTA) to reduce both I/O and computational complexity. These techniques, combined with custom accelerator designs, enable practical sparsity acceleration without relying on an added sparsity predictor. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks show that PADE achieves 7.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia H100 GPU.

However, their growing scale and video-level inputs lead to significant computational and memory overhead, posing challenges for real-time deployment on hardware accelerators. While prior work attempts to reduce redundancy via token pruning or merging, these methods typically operate at coarse granularity and incur high runtime overhead due to global token-level operations. In this study, we propose Focus, a Streaming Concentration Architecture that efficiently accelerates VLM inference through progressive, fine-grained redundancy elimination. Focus introduces a multilevel concentration paradigm that hierarchically compresses vision-language inputs at three levels: (1) semantic-guided token pruning based on textual prompts, (2) spatial-temporal block-level concentration using localized comparisons, and (3) vector-level redundancy removal via motion-aware matching. All concentration steps are tightly co-designed with the architecture to support streaming-friendly, on-chip execution. Focus leverages GEMM tiling, convolution-style layout, and cross-modal attention to minimize off-chip access while enabling high throughput. Implemented as a modular unit within a systolic-array accelerator, Focus achieves a 2.4x speedup and 3.3x reduction in energy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art accelerators in both performance and energy efficiency.

This decentralization is achieved through the implementation of microservice architectures, which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA) such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure SLA compliance. This is achieved by sophisticated orchestration strategies such as Kubernetes, which help facilitate resource management. The orchestration strategies alone do not guarantee SLA adherence due to the inherent delay of scaling resources. Existing auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to address these challenges, but they suffer from performance issues and configuration complexity. In this paper, a novel auto-scaling algorithm is proposed for SLA-constrained edge computing applications. This approach combines a Machine Learning (ML) based proactive auto-scaling algorithm, capable of predicting incoming resource requests to forecast demand, with a reactive autoscaler which considers current resource utilization and SLA constraints for immediate adjustments. The algorithm is integrated into Kubernetes as an extension, and its performance is evaluated through extensive experiments in an edge environment with real applications. The results demonstrate that existing solutions have an SLA violation rate of up to 23%, whereas the proposed hybrid solution outperforms the baselines with an SLA violation rate of only 6%, ensuring stable SLA compliance across various applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u7f29\u5bb9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u969c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u7b49\u7ea7\u534f\u8bae\uff08SLA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Kubernetes\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176SLA\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a6%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u7f29\u5bb9\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683cSLA\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408ML\u9884\u6d4b\u5f0f\u6269\u7f29\u5bb9\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u53caSLA\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u6269\u7f29\u5bb9\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230Kubernetes\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5c06SLA\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u4ece\u6700\u9ad823%\u964d\u81f36%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6df7\u5408\u6269\u7f29\u5bb9\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4eSLA\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models.

In other situations the parallel tasks have constraints that require them to synchronize their start and possibly departure times. This is true of many parallelized machine learning workloads, and the popular Apache Spark processing engine has recently added support for Barrier Execution Mode, which allows users to add such barriers to their jobs. These barriers necessarily result in idle periods on some of the workers, which reduces their stability and performance, compared to equivalent workloads with no barriers.\n  In this paper we will consider and analyze the stability and performance penalties resulting from barriers. We include an analysis of the stability of $(s,k,l)$ barrier systems that allow jobs to depart after $l$ out of $k$ of their tasks complete. We also derive and evaluate performance bounds for hybrid barrier systems servicing a mix of jobs, both with and without barriers, and with varying degrees of parallelism.

Recent studies demonstrate an average 39% performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple turns, with models making premature assumptions and failing to course correct (Laban et al., 2025). This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context.\n  We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness. Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations. Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content. Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "ContextBranch\u5f15\u5165\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u8bed\u4e49\u7ba1\u7406LLM\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u652f\u673a\u5236\u9694\u79bb\u63a2\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1checkpoint\u3001branch\u3001switch\u3001inject\u56db\u4e2a\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u8bdd\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u5b58\u3001\u5206\u652f\u9694\u79bb\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5408\u5e76\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5206\u652f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1158.1%\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6d88\u606f\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5206\u652f\u662fAI\u8f85\u52a9\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c61\u67d3\u3002"}}

While compact models are the ultimate deployment target, conventional pruning-aware distributed training systems typically fail to reduce communication overhead because unstructured sparsity cannot be efficiently exploited by highly optimized dense collective primitives. We present PruneX, a distributed data-parallel training system that co-designs pruning algorithms with cluster hierarchy to reduce inter-node bandwidth usage. PruneX introduces the Hierarchical Structured ADMM (H-SADMM) algorithm, which enforces node-level structured sparsity before inter-node synchronization, enabling dynamic buffer compaction that eliminates both zero-valued transmissions and indexing overhead. The system adopts a leader-follower execution model with separated intra-node and inter-node process groups, performing dense collectives on compacted tensors over bandwidth-limited links while confining full synchronization to high-bandwidth intra-node interconnects. Evaluation on ResNet architectures across 64 GPUs demonstrates that PruneX reduces inter-node communication volume by approximately 60% and achieves 6.75x strong scaling speedup, outperforming the dense baseline (5.81x) and Top-K gradient compression (3.71x) on the Puhti supercomputer at CSC - IT Center for Science (Finland).", "AI": {"tldr": "PruneX\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u96c6\u7fa4\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u8282\u70b9GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faH-SADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f3a\u5236\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u79bb\u8282\u70b9\u5185\u5916\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "result": "\u572864\u4e2aGPU\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8de8\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea660%\uff0c\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u8fbe6.75\u500d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548cTop-K\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PruneX\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce PerfCoder, a family of LLMs specifically designed to generate performance-enhanced code from source code via interpretable, customized optimizations. PerfCoder is fine-tuned on a curated collection of real-world optimization trajectories with human-readable annotations, and preference-aligned by reinforcement fine-tuning using runtime measurements, enabling it to propose input-specific improvement strategies and apply them directly without relying on iterative refinement. On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes.

Property-based testing addresses this shortcoming by generating multiple inputs satisfying properties but requires significant manual effort to define properties and their constraints. We propose a semantics-based approach that automatically transforms unit tests into property-based tests by extracting specifications from implementations via single-path symbolic analysis. We demonstrate this approach through Teralizer, a prototype for Java that transforms JUnit tests into property-based jqwik tests. Unlike prior work that generalizes from input-output examples, Teralizer derives specifications from program semantics.\n  We evaluated Teralizer on three progressively challenging datasets. On EvoSuite-generated tests for EqBench and Apache Commons utilities, Teralizer improved mutation scores by 1-4 percentage points. Generalization of mature developer-written tests from Apache Commons utilities showed only 0.05-0.07 percentage points improvement. Analysis of 632 real-world Java projects from RepoReapers highlights applicability barriers: only 1.7% of projects completed the generalization pipeline, with failures primarily due to type support limitations in symbolic analysis and static analysis limitations in our prototype. Based on the results, we provide a roadmap for future work, identifying research and engineering challenges that need to be tackled to advance the field of test generalization.\n  Artifacts available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17950381", "AI": {"tldr": "Teralizer\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7c7b\u578b\u652f\u6301\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5355\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u591a\u7ec4\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5c06JUnit\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u4e3ajqwik\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728EvoSuite\u548cApache Commons\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u53d8\u5f02\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u53471-4\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u6210\u719f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u63d0\u53470.05-0.07\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b632\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u4ec51.7%\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u7c7b\u578b\u652f\u6301\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u7a0b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65b9\u80fd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u3002"}}

However, developing cloud-of-things (CoT) applications remains challenging. It requires significant technical expertise and lacks standardized, model-driven methodologies. Current approaches fail to ensure interoperability, automation, and efficiency. This study introduces the Model of Things (MoT), a model-based approach that incorporates low-code principles to simplify CoT development. MoT reduces technical barriers by providing a custom UML profile designed for IoT and cloud services. To evaluate MoT, we conducted a case study and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The results confirmed MoT's feasibility, demonstrating that it streamlines CoT application development and deployment. Users found MoT accessible, even with limited IoT experience, and reported high perceived ease of use and usefulness. Qualitative feedback highlighted MoT's ability to reduce complexity and speed up development. MoT offers a promising, model-driven solution for CoT application development. By lowering entry barriers and promoting automation, it enhances both efficiency and flexibility. This study represents a step toward a more user-friendly framework, enabling broader adoption of CoT technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f4e\u4ee3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e91\u7269\u878d\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6613\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e91\u7269\u878d\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u95e8\u69db\u9ad8\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faModel of Things\uff08MoT\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408UML\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u4e0e\u4f4e\u4ee3\u7801\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e0eTAM\u95ee\u5377\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eMoT\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u53d1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u6613\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "MoT\u4e3a\u4e91\u7269\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u3002"}}

As these systems scale, sustainability concerns have intensified, with most assessments focusing on model architecture, hardware efficiency, and deployment infrastructure. However, existing mitigation efforts largely overlook how user interaction practices themselves shape the energy profile of LLM based systems. In this vision paper, we argue that interaction level behavior appears to be an underexamined factor shaping the environmental impact of LLM based systems, and we present this issue across four dimensions. First, extended conversational patterns increase token production and raise the computational cost of inference. Second, expectations of instant responses limit opportunities for energy aware scheduling and workload consolidation. Third, everyday user habits contribute to cumulative operational demand in ways that are rarely quantified. Fourth, the accumulation of context affects memory requirements and reduces the efficiency of long running dialogues. Addressing these challenges requires rethinking how chatbot interactions are designed and conceptualized, and adopting perspectives that recognize sustainability as partly dependent on the conversational norms through which users engage with LLM based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9LLM\u804a\u5929\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89d2\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u8017\uff1a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u671f\u671b\u3001\u7528\u6237\u4e60\u60ef\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u8bdd\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e5f\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8bdd\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002"}}
