Ruby, despite its widespread use in web\ndevelopment and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received\nlittle attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel\nlightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven,\niterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that\ngenerate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a\ncorrect solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid\nreliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead\noperating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven\nfeedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a\npass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly\nwithin five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and\nself-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that\nRAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors,\nand runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair\nstrategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging\ntools to under-studied languages."}

In the ideal case, the detector achieves near-optimal performance\nwhile benefiting from Grover's quadratic speedup, reducing the search cost from\nfrom O(M^N) exhaustive evaluations to O(SQRT(M^N)) oracle queries.

To address these limitations, we first\nconstruct a challenging and dynamically curated E2EDevBench to simulate\nrealistic development scenarios. Second, we propose a hybrid evaluation\nframework that combines test-case-based functional assessment with\nfine-grained, LLM-based requirement verification. Using this framework, we\nconduct a controlled empirical study on three representative agent\narchitectures implemented upon a unified foundation to isolate the impact of\nworkflow design. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art agents can fulfill\napproximately 50\\% of requirements on \\bench{}, but their success is critically\ndependent on the architectural strategy for task decomposition and\ncollaboration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the primary bottleneck\nis the omission of requirements and inadequate self-verification. This work\nprovides the community with a more realistic benchmark, a comprehensive\nevaluation framework, and crucial insights into the current capabilities and\ncore challenges of software development agents, guiding future research toward\nenhancing requirement comprehension and planning."}

However, the pursuit of higher\nperformance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating\nfrequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly\ndegrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional\ncircuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are\nresource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To\naddress these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware\nco-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM.\nInitially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties\nof PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between\nPIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS,\nenabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while\nmaintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently,\nwe develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates\nsoftware-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt\nthe V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and\nperformance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging\nsoftware and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout\nsimulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up\nto 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement\nand 1.152x speedup."}

Recent observations suggest that the internal\nactivations of LLMs are often dynamically sparse, meaning that for each input,\nonly part of the network contributes significantly to the output. Such sparsity\ncould reduce computation, but it interacts poorly with group-wise quantization,\nwhich remains the dominant approach for fitting LLMs onto resource-constrained\nhardware. To reconcile these two properties, this study proposes a set of\ntechniques that realize dynamic sparse inference under low-bit quantization.\nThe method features: (1) a zigzag-patterned quantization layout that organizes\nweights in a way consistent with activation sparsity and improves GPU memory\nlocality; (2) a specialized GEMV kernel designed for this layout to fully\nutilize parallel compute units; and (3) a compact runtime mechanism that\ngathers sparse indices with minimal overhead. Across several model scales and\nhardware configurations, the approach achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding\nthroughput while maintaining accuracy comparable to dense quantized inference,\nshowing that structured sparsity and quantization can effectively coexist on\ncommodity GPUs."}
