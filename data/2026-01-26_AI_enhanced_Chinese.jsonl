Modern platforms with matrix multiplication accelerators exhibit high FLOP/Byte machine balance, which makes implementing optimal matrix multiplication challenging. On modern CPU platforms with matrix engines, state-of-the-art vendor libraries tune input tensor layouts, parallelization schemes, and cache blocking to minimize data movement across the memory hierarchy and maximize throughput. However, the best settings for these parameters depend strongly on the target platform (number of cores, memory hierarchy, cache sizes) and on the shapes of the matrices, making exhaustive tuning infeasible; in practice this leads to performance \"glass jaws\". In this work we revisit space filling curves (SFC) to alleviate the problem of this cumbersome tuning. SFC convert multi-dimensional coordinates (e.g. 2D) into a single dimension (1D), keeping nearby points in the high-dimensional space close in the 1D order. We partition the Matrix Multiplication computation space using recent advancements in generalized SFC (Generalized Hilbert Curves), and we obtain platform-oblivious and shape-oblivious matrix-multiplication schemes that exhibit inherently high degree of data locality. Furthermore, we extend the SFC-based work partitioning to implement Communication-Avoiding (CA) algorithms that replicate the input tensors and provably minimize communication/data-movement on the critical path. The integration of CA-algorithms is seamless and yields compact code (~30 LOC), yet it achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple CPU platforms, outperforming vendor libraries by up to 2x(geometric-mean speedup) for a range of GEMM shapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u586b\u5145\u66f2\u7ebf\uff08SFC\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u9488\u5bf9\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8c03\u53c2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e73\u53f0\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff08\u5982'\u73bb\u7483\u988c'\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u8c03\u53c2\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u66f2\u7ebf\u5c06\u591a\u7ef4\u5750\u6807\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ef4\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u901a\u4fe1\u907f\u514d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u590d\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u5f20\u91cf\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e34\u754c\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u7cbe\u7b80\uff08\u7ea630\u884c\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aCPU\u5e73\u53f0\u5ab2\u6e21\u8fdd\u4f26\u7840\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u5747\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u4f18\u4e8e\u5382\u5546\u5e93\u9ad8\u8fbe2\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SFC\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, its efficient deployment on Huawei's Ascend 910 Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is challenging due to limited native mixed-precision support and the accelerator's decoupled compute architecture. To enable quantization on such architecture, we present the first practical W4A16 matrix multiplication kernel tailored for the Ascend 910 NPU. Our design leverages vector cores for on-the-fly INT4-to-FP16 dequantization, cube cores for high-throughput GEMM, and Split-K parallelization to mitigate memory latency. Performance evaluations across diverse matrix shapes and batch sizes show our method outperforms data-parallel approaches when K >> N, a typical scenario in LLM decoding. Specially, our method can achieve a speedup ranging from 1.01x to 1.74x. In addition, our profile reveals the primary bottleneck is not dequantization compution itself, but extra global memory transfer for the weight, making W4A16 only reaching a maximum speedup of 1.48x over native FP16xFP16 matrix multiplication in PyTorch.

Classical work by Holmstr\u00f6m established that under pure self-interest, Nash equilibrium is universal shirking. While i* represents teams as composite actors, it lacks scalable computational mechanisms for analyzing how collective action problems emerge and resolve in coopetitive settings. This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%).

Conventional OTA update mechanisms rely on reboots and incur significant overhead, rendering them unsuitable for intermittently powered systems. Recent live OTA update techniques reduce reboot overhead but still lack mechanisms to ensure consistency when updates interact with runtime execution. This paper presents AERO, an Adaptive and Efficient Runtime-Aware OTA update mechanism that integrates update tasks into the device's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and schedules them alongside routine tasks under energy and timing constraints. By identifying update-affected execution regions and dynamically adjusting dependencies, AERO ensures consistent up date integration while adapting to intermittent energy availability.

Checkpointing this massive, distributed state is critical for a wide range of use cases, such as resilience, suspend-resume, investigating undesirable training trajectories, and explaining model evolution. However, existing checkpointing solutions typically treat model state as opaque binary blobs, ignoring the ``3D heterogeneity'' of the underlying data structures--varying by memory location (GPU vs. Host), number of ``logical'' objects sharded and split across multiple files, data types (tensors vs. Python objects), and their serialization requirements. This results in significant runtime overheads due to blocking device-to-host transfers, data-oblivious serialization, and storage I/O contention. In this paper, we introduce DataStates-LLM, a novel checkpointing architecture that leverages State Providers to decouple state abstraction from data movement. DataStates-LLM exploits the immutability of model parameters during the forward and backward passes to perform ``lazy'', non-blocking asynchronous snapshots. By introducing State Providers, we efficiently coalesce fragmented, heterogeneous shards and overlap the serialization of metadata with bulk tensor I/O. We evaluate DataStates-LLM on models up to 70B parameters on 256 A100-40GB GPUs. Our results demonstrate that DataStates-LLM achieves up to 4$\\times$ higher checkpointing throughput and reduces end-to-end training time by up to 2.2$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions, effectively mitigating the serialization and heterogeneity bottlenecks in extreme-scale LLM training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While modern issue-tracking systems facilitate the reporting of such problems, labeling concurrency-related bug reports remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. This paper presents a linguistic-pattern-based framework for automatically identifying concurrency bug reports. We derive 58 distinct linguistic patterns from 730 manually labeled concurrency bug reports, organized across four levels: word-level (keywords), phrase-level (n-grams), sentence-level (semantic), and bug report-level (contextual). To assess their effectiveness, we evaluate four complementary approaches-matching, learning, prompt-based, and fine-tuning-spanning traditional machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and pre-trained language models (PLMs). Our comprehensive evaluation on 12 large-scale open-source projects (10,920 issue reports from GitHub and Jira) demonstrates that fine-tuning PLMs with linguistic-pattern-enriched inputs achieves the best performance, reaching a precision of 91% on GitHub and 93% on Jira, and maintaining strong precision on post cut-off data (91%). The contributions of this work include: (1) a comprehensive taxonomy of linguistic patterns for concurrency bugs, (2) a novel fine-tuning strategy that integrates domain-specific linguistic knowledge into PLMs, and (3) a curated, labeled dataset to support reproducible research.

This paper presents a novel, end-to-end real-time V2X Digital Twin framework that integrates live mobility tracking with deterministic channel simulation.

Our results demonstrate the system's ability to predict Received Signal Strength (RSSI) with a maximum average error of 1.01 dB and reliably forecast Line-of-Sight (LoS) transitions within a maximum average end-to-end system latency of 250 ms, depending on the ray tracing level of detail.

Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation.

Programming languages and execution models strongly influence software energy consumption, with interpreted languages generally being less efficient than compiled ones. Lua illustrates this trade-off: despite its popularity, it is less energy-efficient than greener and faster languages such as C.\n  This paper presents an empirical study of Lua's runtime performance and energy efficiency across 25 official interpreter versions and just-in-time (JIT) compilers. Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter.

This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements. By keeping stakeholders in the validation loop, this approach promotes responsible and trustworthy use of AI in Requirements Engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers.

In the age of service-orientation (a.k.a. Software as a Service (SaaS)) APIs have become core business assets and can easily expose hundreds of operations. While well-designed APIs contribute to the commercial success of a service, poorly designed APIs can threaten entire organizations. Recognizing their relevance and value, many guidelines have been proposed for designing usable APIs, similar to design patterns and coding standards. For example, Zalando and Microsoft provide popular REST API guidelines. However, they are often considered as too large and inapplicable, so many companies create and maintain their own guidelines, which is a challenge in itself. In practice, however, developers still struggle to design effective REST APIs. To improve the situation, we need to improve our empirical understanding of adopting, using, and creating REST API guidelines.\n  We present an interview study with 16 REST API experts from industry. We determine the notion of API usability, guideline effectiveness factors, challenges of adopting and designing guidelines, and best practices. We identified eight factors influencing REST API usability, among which the adherence to conventions is the most important one. While guidelines can in fact be an effective means to improve API usability, there is significant resistance from developers against strict guidelines. Guideline size and how it fits with organizational needs are two important factors to consider. REST guidelines also have to grow with the organization, while all stakeholders need to be involved in their development and maintenance.

While various context compression approaches such as LongLLMLingua have emerged to tackle this challenge, they typically rely on fixed metrics such as PPL, ignoring the task-specific nature of code understanding. As a result, they frequently disrupt syntactic and logical structure and fail to retain critical implementation details. In this paper, we propose SWE-Pruner, a self-adaptive context pruning framework tailored for coding agents. Drawing inspiration from how human programmers \"selectively skim\" source code during development and debugging, SWE-Pruner performs task-aware adaptive pruning for long contexts. Given the current task, the agent formulates an explicit goal (e.g., \"focus on error handling\") as a hint to guide the pruning targets. A lightweight neural skimmer (0.6B parameters) is trained to dynamically select relevant lines from the surrounding context given the goal. Evaluations across four benchmarks and multiple models validate SWE-Pruner's effectiveness in various scenarios, achieving 23-54% token reduction on agent tasks like SWE-Bench Verified and up to 14.84x compression on single-turn tasks like LongCodeQA with minimal performance impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines.

Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p < 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cram\u00e9r's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics. The bottleneck for agent-generated code may not be generation quality, but the organizational practices that govern its long-term evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660eAI\u52a9\u624b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7801\u5b58\u6d3b\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\uff08\u4fee\u6539\u7387\u4f4e15.8%\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7ffb\u4e86'\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u4ee3\u7801'\u5047\u8bf4\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u4fee\u590d\u7387\u7565\u9ad8\u4e14\u4fee\u6539\u65f6\u673a\u9884\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u754c\u8ba4\u4e3aAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u88ab\u5feb\u901f\u5e9f\u5f03\u7684\u5047\u8bf4\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c06\u7ef4\u62a4\u8d1f\u62c5\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u4fee\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76201\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d20\u4f59\u4e07\u6761AI\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4fee\u6539\u7387\u3001\u4fee\u590d\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "AI\u4ee3\u7801\u5b58\u6d3b\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff08\u98ce\u9669\u6bd4HR=0.842, p<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4fee\u590d\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0826.3%vs23.0%\uff09\uff1b\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6613\u4fee\u6539\u4ee3\u7801\uff08AUC=0.671\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4fee\u6539\u65f6\u673a\u9884\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\uff08F1=0.285\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u4e0d\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ba1\u7406\u5176\u957f\u671f\u6f14\u8fdb\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While prior studies have examined AI-generated source code, the impact of AI coding agents on build systems-a critical yet understudied component of the software lifecycle-remains largely unexplored. This data mining challenge focuses on AIDev, the first large-scale, openly available dataset capturing agent-authored pull requests (Agentic-PRs) from real-world GitHub repositories. Our paper leverages this dataset to investigate (RQ1) whether AI coding agents generate build code with quality issues (e.g., code smells), (RQ2) to what extent AI agents can eliminate code smells from build code, and (RQ3) to what extent Agentic-PRs are accepted by developers. We identified 364 maintainability and security-related build smells across varying severity levels, indicating that AI-generated build code can introduce quality issues-such as lack of error handling, and hardcoded paths or URLs-while also, in some cases, removing existing smells through refactorings (e.g., Pull Up Module and Externalize Properties). Notably, more than 61\\% of Agentic-PRs are approved and merged with minimal human intervention. This dual impact underscores the need for future research on AI-aware build code quality assessment to systematically evaluate, guide, and govern AI-generated build systems code.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose and assess a selective instrumentation approach tailored to large game engines written in \\texttt{C++}, which reduces the scope of instrumentation while preserving relevant coverage data to developer commits. Our framework integrates into an industrial game testing pipeline, enabling developers to receive immediate coverage feedback on tests run against their changes. The compilation overhead of our approach is minimal, allowing instrumentation of over 2,000 commits before doubling build time. In performance evaluations, even the worst-case scenario maintains frame rates above 50\\% of the non-instrumented baseline. Across two production test suites maintained by our industry partner, our framework caused no automated test failures, avoiding the instability observed under full instrumentation. Our work shows that commit-level or build-level coverage of large \\texttt{C++} game engines can be achieved with minimal overhead and without compromising test stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3AAA\u6e38\u620f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u91cf\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728AAA\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578bC++\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5de5\u4e1a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f29\u51cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u63d0\u4ea4\u76f8\u5173\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u7f16\u8bd1\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\uff082000\u6b21\u63d0\u4ea4\u540e\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u624d\u7ffb\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u5dee\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u4fdd\u630150%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5e27\u7387\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u751f\u4ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u5f00\u9500\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u578bC++\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4/\u6784\u5efa\u7ea7\u8986\u76d6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}
