An Empirical Study of Dependency Amplification Across 10 Package Ecosystems", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern software development relies on package ecosystems where a single declared dependency can pull in many additional transitive packages. This dependency amplification, defined as the ratio of transitive to direct dependencies, has major implications for software supply chain security, yet amplification patterns across ecosystems have not been compared at scale. We present an empirical study of 500 projects across ten major ecosystems, including Maven Central for Java, npm Registry for JavaScript, crates io for Rust, PyPI for Python, NuGet Gallery for dot NET, RubyGems for Ruby, Go Modules for Go, Packagist for PHP, CocoaPods for Swift and Objective C, and Pub for Dart. Our analysis shows that Maven exhibits mean amplification of 24.70 times, compared to 4.48 times for Go Modules, 4.32 times for npm, and 0.32 times for CocoaPods. We find significant differences with large effect sizes in 22 of 45 pairwise comparisons, challenging the assumption that npm has the highest amplification due to its many small purpose packages. We observe that 28 percent of Maven projects exceed 10 times amplification, indicating a systematic pattern rather than isolated outliers, compared to 14 percent for RubyGems, 12 percent for npm, and zero percent for Cargo, PyPI, Packagist, CocoaPods, and Pub. We attribute these differences to ecosystem design choices such as dependency resolution behavior, standard library completeness, and platform constraints. Our findings suggest adopting ecosystem specific security strategies, including systematic auditing for Maven environments, targeted outlier detection for npm and RubyGems, and continuation of current practices for ecosystems with controlled amplification. We provide a full replication package with data and analysis scripts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5341\u5927\u4e3b\u6d41\u5305\u7ba1\u7406\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Maven\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u653e\u5927\u500d\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\uff0824.70\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u800cCocoaPods\u6700\u4f4e\uff080.32\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u91c7\u53d6\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4f9d\u8d56\u5305\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u653e\u5927\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8fd9\u5173\u7cfb\u5230\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u5341\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684500\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u4f20\u9012\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "Maven\u653e\u5927\u500d\u6570\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u751f\u6001\uff1b28%\u7684Maven\u9879\u76ee\u653e\u5927\u8d8510\u500d\uff1bnpm\u5e76\u975e\u653e\u5927\u6700\u4e25\u91cd\u8005\uff1b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5982\u4f9d\u8d56\u89e3\u6790\u673a\u5236\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7b49\u662f\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\u5236\u5b9a\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff1aMaven\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0cnpm\u548cRubyGems\u9700\u91cd\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4f4e\u653e\u5927\u751f\u6001\u53ef\u7ef4\u6301\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

Previous machine learning and deep learning detection tools are constrained by their reliance on large-scale labeled data and an lack of interpretability. Although multi-agent systems have demonstrated robust capabilities, the potential of such systems for PCOS detection remains largely unexplored. Existing medical multi-agent frameworks are predominantly designed for general medical tasks, suffering from insufficient domain integration and a lack of specific domain knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Mapis, the first knowledge-grounded multi-agent framework explicitly designed for guideline-based PCOS diagnosis. Specifically, it built upon the 2023 International Guideline into a structured collaborative workflow that simulates the clinical diagnostic process. It decouples complex diagnostic tasks across specialized agents: a gynecological endocrine agent and a radiology agent collaborative to verify inclusion criteria, while an exclusion agent strictly rules out other causes. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive PCOS knowledge graph to ensure verifiable, evidence-based decision-making. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and specialized clinical datasets, benchmarking against nine diverse baselines, demonstrate that Mapis significantly outperforms competitive methods. On the clinical dataset, it surpasses traditional machine learning models by 13.56%, single-agent by 6.55%, and previous medical multi-agent systems by 7.05% in Accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMapis\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u5357\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684PCOS\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PCOS\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u533b\u7597\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e2023\u56fd\u9645\u6307\u5357\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5987\u79d1\u5185\u5206\u6ccc\u3001\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u548c\u6392\u9664\u75c5\u56e0\u4e09\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5PCOS\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMapis\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad813.56%\uff0c\u8f83\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9ad86.55%\uff0c\u8f83\u65e2\u6709\u533b\u7597\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad87.05%\u3002", "conclusion": "Mapis\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347PCOS\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e13\u79d1\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To quantify this, we introduce a new metric, reliable@k, and develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. Building upon this, we construct IFEval++ for systematic evaluation. Across 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs, we find that current models exhibit substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability -- their performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications.

Developers need to implement various kinds of functionalities to cover law needs, including user rights and law principles. As data compliance is tightly coupled with legal knowledge, it is not always easy to perform such integrations in software systems. Prior studies have focused on developers' understanding of privacy principles, such as Privacy by Design, and have examined privacy techniques used in the software industry. Nevertheless, emerging developer needs that can assist in privacy law compliance have not been examined but are useful in understanding what development automation tools, such as Generative AI, need to cover to make the compliance process more straightforward and seamless within the development process.

Pre-training produces intelligence, and post-training optimizes preferences, but neither guarantees that models reliably satisfy explicit, context-dependent constraints. This missing abstraction explains why highly intelligent models routinely fail in deployment despite strong benchmark performance.\n  We introduce Capability Engineering, the systematic practice of converting requirements into executable specifications and training models to satisfy them by default. We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.\n  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent). By replacing per-example annotation with reusable specifications, CAPE reduces costs by 5 to 20 times and shortens timelines from months to weeks.\n  We release the CAPE protocol, PredicateGraph schema, CPL specification language, and policy packs under Apache 2.0.

Although CPU-optimized implementations have been well studied, GPU designs remain underexplored. We close this gap by exploring the design space on GPUs along three dimensions: vectorization, thread cooperation, and compute latency.\n  Our evaluation shows that the combination of these optimization points strongly affects throughput, with the largest gains achieved when the filter fits within the GPU's cache domain. We examine how the hardware responds to different parameter configurations and relate these observations to measured performance trends. Crucially, our optimized design overcomes the conventional trade-off between speed and precision, delivering the throughput typically restricted to high-error variants while maintaining the superior accuracy of high-precision configurations.

However, the high computational cost of HE operations, particularly matrix multiplication (MM), remains a major barrier to its practical deployment. Accelerating homomorphic encrypted MM (HE MM) is therefore crucial for applications such as privacy-preserving machine learning.\n  In this paper, we present a bandwidth-efficient FPGA implementation of HE MM. We first develop a cost model to evaluate the on-chip memory requirements for a given set of HE parameters and input matrix sizes. Our analysis shows that optimizing on-chip memory usage is critical for scalable and efficient HE MM. To this end, we design a novel datapath for Homomorphic Linear Transformation (HLT), the primary bottleneck in HE MM. The proposed datapath significantly reduces off-chip memory traffic and on-chip memory demand by enabling fine-grained data reuse. Leveraging this datapath, we introduce FAME, the first FPGA-based accelerator specifically tailored for HE MM. FAME supports arbitrary matrix shapes and is configurable across a wide range of HE parameter sets. We implement FAME on an Alveo U280 FPGA and evaluate its performance across diverse matrix sizes and shapes.

While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \\cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points.

This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the \"two-language problem\": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++.

Research focused on improving systems performance is especially well-suited to this paradigm because system performance problems naturally admit such verifiers: candidates can be implemented in real systems or simulators and evaluated against predefined workloads. We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight.

However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the same time. Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable. DREX also efficiently handles the missing KV cache from skipped layers using memory-efficient state-copying.

This is particularly beneficial for video, which dominates network traffic and demands high bandwidth and power, making semantic approaches ideal for conserving resources while maintaining quality. In this paper, we propose a Predictability-aware and Entropy-adaptive Neural Motion Estimation (PENME) method to address challenges related to high latency, high bitrate, and power consumption in video transmission. PENME makes per-frame decisions to select a residual motion extraction model, convolutional neural network, vision transformer, or optical flow, using a five-step policy based on motion strength, global motion consistency, peak sharpness, heterogeneity, and residual error. The residual motions are then transmitted to the receiver, where the frames are reconstructed via motion-compensated updates. Next, a selective diffusion-based refinement, the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-4), is applied on frames that trigger refinement due to low predictability or large residuals, while predictable frames skip refinement. PENME also allocates radio resource blocks with awareness of residual motion and channel state, reducing power consumption and bandwidth usage while maintaining high semantic similarity. Our simulation results on the Vimeo90K dataset demonstrate that the proposed PENME method handles various types of video, outperforming traditional communication, hybrid, and adaptive bitrate semantic communication techniques, achieving 40% lower latency, 90% less transmitted data, and 35% higher throughput. For semantic communication metrics, PENME improves PSNR by about 40%, increases MS-SSIM by roughly 19%, and reduces LPIPS by nearly 35%, compared with the baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPENME\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6269\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u5e26\u5bbd\u6d88\u8017\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9999\u519c\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u805a\u7126\u610f\u4e49\u4f20\u8f93\u4ee5\u8282\u7701\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e94\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408LCM-4\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6269\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u5e27\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u914d\u65e0\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5728Vimeo90K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e40%\uff0c\u4f20\u8f93\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c1190%\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad835%\uff0cPSNR\u3001MS-SSIM\u548cLPIPS\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534740%\u300119%\u548c\u964d\u4f4e35%\u3002", "conclusion": "PENME\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks involve simple programs, failing to represent real-world complexities such as inter- or intra-procedural dependencies, core or third-party API calls, highly nested constructs, and non-primitive complex types. Evaluating LLMs under such a simplistic setting poses a significant threat to assumptions about their generalizability in practice. To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects. RE2-Bench leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize and deserialize compound, complex, and custom types in real-world code, going far beyond the primitive-only settings used in prior work.\n  A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\\% for input prediction and 42.15\\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRE2-Bench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b1101\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ee3\u7801\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9LLM\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bef\u5224\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u52a8\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e5d\u9879\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u7684\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u5212\u5206\u96be\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\u3002", "result": "\u516d\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u5728Easy\u5230Hard\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u964d51.5%\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u964d42.15%\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5148\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RE2-Bench\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7cbe\u51c6\u6821\u51c6LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure.

While top-tier SE venues continue to show sustained or emerging focus on areas like automated testing and program repair, with researchers worldwide reporting continuous performance gains, the alignment of these academic advances with real industrial needs remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 1,367 papers published in FSE, ASE, and ICSE between 2022 and 2025, identifying key research topics, commonly used benchmarks, industrial relevance, and open-source availability. We then carry out an empirical survey across 17 organizations, collecting 282 responses on six prominent topics, i.e., program analysis, automated testing, code generation/completion, issue resolution, pre-trained code models, and dependency management, through structured questionnaires. By contrasting academic capabilities with industrial feedback, we derive seven critical implications, highlighting under-addressed challenges in software requirements and architecture, the reliability and explainability of intelligent SE approaches, input assumptions in academic research, practical evaluation tensions, and ethical considerations.

DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency. A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues. Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs. The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers. It integrates: (i) adaptive conformance mechanisms that link metamodels with evolving models and (ii) a large language model (LLM) validated alignment process that grounds metamodels in domain knowledge, ensuring structural fidelity and conceptual consistency throughout the DT lifecycle. This approach automates semantic correspondences discovery, minimizes manual mapping, and enhances scalability across diverse model types.

Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web", "comment": "Accepted on ICSE 2026", "summary": "Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings.

These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine. Our contribution enables the AAS to serve not only as a passive digital representation but also as an active interface for executing added-value services.%, thereby laying the foundation for future AI-driven adaptation and system-level intelligence in digital twin environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u8d44\u4ea7 administration shell (AAS) \u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u589e\u503c\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 AAS \u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u670d\u52a1\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u66f4\u5927\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u5165\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u89e6\u53d1\u6761\u4ef6\u90e8\u7f72\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u4ee5\u4e09\u8f74\u94e3\u5e8a\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 AAS \u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f AAS \u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u955c\u50cf\uff0c\u66f4\u6210\u4e3a\u6267\u884c\u589e\u503c\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765 AI \u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u667a\u80fd\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing evaluation methods for code review generation either rely on automatic comparisons to a single ground truth, which fails to capture the variability of human perspectives, or on subjective assessments of \"usefulness\", a highly ambiguous concept. We propose a novel evaluation approach based on what we call multi-subjective ranking. Using a dataset of 280 self-contained code review requests and corresponding comments from CodeReview StackExchange, multiple human judges ranked the quality of ChatGPT-generated comments alongside the top human responses from the platform. Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers.

This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.\n  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u6362\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8bb8\u53ef\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u4ee3\u7801\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u53d7\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u9650\u5236\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b64\u7c7b\u8fdd\u89c4\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u6362\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5982\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\uff09\u53ef\u4f7fMI\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u964d10.19%\uff0c\u4f46\u7ec4\u5408\u53d8\u6362\u672a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u524a\u5f31\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d8\u6362\u540e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d1.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89c4\u907f\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bb8\u53ef\u5408\u89c4\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002"}}
