This limitation is\nevident in open-world software environments, where emerging challenges\ntranscend established paradigms.\n  We propose U2F (Unknown Unknowns to Functional solutions), a\ncognitive-inspired, uncertainty-embracing multi-agent framework that\nsystematically surfaces \"Unknown Unknowns\" - novel solution pathways absent\nfrom initial formulations but holding innovative potential. U2F consists of two\nkey components: (1) a Discovery-Exploration-Integration agent system for\nuncovering and synthesizing potential solutions, and (2) cognitive enhancement\nmechanisms across three dimensions: cross-domain analogical reasoning, reverse\nthinking, and external validation, which strategically reframe and extend\nconventional solution boundaries.\n  Applied to 218 real-world software enabler stories curated from authentic\nengineering tasks, U2F achieved notable improvements: human experts reported a\n14 percent increase in overall novelty, 51 percent improvement in semantic\nnovelty, and stable feasibility (4.02/5.0), corroborated by an LLM-based\nevaluator. These results highlight the potential of embracing uncertainty as a\ncatalyst for innovation in software engineering."}

While large language models (LLMs)\nhave shown promise in generating code explanations, they often lack grounding\nin the broader software engineering context. We propose a novel approach that\nleverages natural language artifacts from GitHub -- such as pull request\ndescriptions, issue descriptions and discussions, and commit messages -- to\nenhance LLM-based code understanding. Our system consists of three components:\none that extracts and structures relevant GitHub context, another that uses\nthis context to generate high-level explanations of the code's purpose, and a\nthird that validates the explanation. We implemented this as a standalone tool,\nas well as a server within the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling\nintegration with other AI-assisted development tools. Our main use case is that\nof enhancing a standard LLM-based code explanation with code insights that our\nsystem generates. To evaluate explanations' quality, we conducted a small scale\nuser study, with developers of several open projects, as well as developers of\nproprietary projects. Our user study indicates that when insights are generated\nthey often are helpful and non trivial, and are free from hallucinations."}

In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent\nSDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these\ndesiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent\ncomponents of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents,\nwhich has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple\ninterface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the\ndefault case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents\nwith features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security\nand reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability,\nintegrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can\nconnect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS\nCode, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing\nSDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native\nsandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and\nbuilt-in security analysis. Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA\nbenchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Put together, these elements allow\nthe OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for\nprototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably\ndeploying agents at scale."}

This article investigates a\ncritical and underexplored integrity vulnerability: the manipulation of network\nslice allocation to compromise Quality of Service (QoS) and resource integrity.\nWe introduce a threat model, grounded in a risk analysis of permissible yet\ninsecure configurations like null-ciphering (5G-EA0), demonstrating how a rogue\ngNodeB acting as a Man-in-the-Middle can exploit protocol weaknesses to forge\nslice requests and hijack a User Equipment's (UE) connection. Through a\ncomprehensive experimental evaluation on a 5G testbed, we demonstrate the\nattack's versatile and severe impacts. Our findings show this integrity breach\ncan manifest as obvious QoS degradation, such as a 95% bandwidth reduction and\n150% latency increase when forcing UE to a suboptimal slice, or as stealthy\nslice manipulation that is indistinguishable from benign network operation and\ngenerates no core network errors. Furthermore, we validate a systemic resource\ncontamination attack where redirecting a crowd of UE orchestrates a\nDenial-of-Service, causing packet loss to exceed 60% and inducing measurable\nCPU saturation (~80%) on core network User Plane Functions (UPFs). Based on\nthese results, we discuss the profound implications for Service Level\nAgreements (SLAs) and critical infrastructure. We propose concrete, cross-layer\nmitigation strategies for network operators as future work, underscoring the\nurgent need to secure the integrity of dynamic resource management in 5G\nnetworks."}

Duet benchmarking mitigates this by running\ntwo workload versions concurrently on the same VM, exposing them to identical\nexternal interference. However, intra-VM contention between synchronized\nworkloads necessitates additional isolation mechanisms.\n  This work evaluates three such strategies: cgroups and CPU pinning, Docker\ncontainers, and Firecracker MicroVMs. We compare all strategies with an\nunisolated baseline experiment, by running benchmarks with a duet setup\nalongside a noise generator. This noise generator \"steals\" compute resources to\ndegrade performance measurements.\n  All experiments showed different latency distributions while under the\neffects of noise generation, but results show that process isolation generally\nlowered false positives, except for our experiments with Docker containers.\nEven though Docker containers rely internally on cgroups and CPU pinning, they\nwere more susceptible to performance degradation due to noise influence.\nTherefore, we recommend to use process isolation for synchronized workloads,\nwith the exception of Docker containers."}
