Single-thread GEMM implementations are well-optimised with techniques like blocking and autotuning. However, due to the complexity of modern multi-core shared memory systems, it is challenging to determine the number of threads that minimises the multi-thread GEMM runtime. We present a proof-of-concept approach to building an Architecture and Data-Structure Aware Linear Algebra (ADSALA) software library that uses machine learning to optimise the runtime performance of BLAS routines. More specifically, our method uses a machine learning model on-the-fly to automatically select the optimal number of threads for a given GEMM task based on the collected training data. Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u5e93ADSALA\uff0c\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316GEMM\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728Intel\u4e0eAMD\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b025%-40%\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u6838\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u624b\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316GEMM\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaADSALA\u5e93\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728Intel Cascade Lake\u4e0eAMD Zen 3\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfBLAS\u5b9e\u73b0\u83b7\u5f9725%-40%\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528<100MB\u65f6\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6838\u73af\u5883\u4e0bGEMM\u8fd0\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Even brief latency spikes degrade service quality despite acceptable average performance. However, distributed inference environments featuring diverse software frameworks and XPU architectures combined with dynamic workloads make latency analysis challenging. Constrained by intrusive designs that necessitate service restarts or even suspension, and by hardware-bound implementations that fail to adapt to heterogeneous inference environments, existing AI profiling methods are often inadequate for real-time production analysis.\n  We present LatencyPrism, the first zero-intrusion multi-platform latency sculpting system. It aims to break down the inference latency across pipeline, proactively alert on inference latency anomalies, and guarantee adherence to SLOs, all without requiring code modifications or service restarts. LatencyPrism has been deployed across thousands of XPUs for over six months. It enables low-overhead real-time monitoring at batch level with alerts triggered in milliseconds.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MACRO-LLM, LLM-empowered multi-agent collaborative reasoning under spatiotemporal partial observability.

Once the prefill GPU completes its task, the KV cache must be transferred to the decode GPU. While existing works have proposed various KV cache transfer paths across different memory and storage tiers, there remains a lack of systematic benchmarking that compares their performance and energy efficiency. Meanwhile, although optimization techniques such as KV cache reuse and frequency scaling have been utilized for disaggregated serving, their performance and energy implications have not been rigorously benchmarked. In this paper, we fill this research gap by re-evaluating prefill-decode disaggregation under different KV transfer mediums and optimization strategies. Specifically, we include a new colocated serving baseline and evaluate disaggregated setups under different KV cache transfer paths. Through GPU profiling using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), we identify and compare the performance-energy Pareto frontiers across all setups to evaluate the potential energy savings enabled by disaggregation. Our results show that performance benefits from prefill-decode disaggregation are not guaranteed and depend on the request load and KV transfer mediums.

These tools have lowered the cost of code generation, explanation, and testing, while introducing new forms of automation into routine development tasks.

This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model.

Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. We present a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without the prohibitive computational costs associated with model post-training. Leveraging the GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework, we iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop. This process utilizes crossover and mutation of instructions, guided by expert-curated gold examples and structured feedback based on clause- and clause parameter-level mismatches between the gold and predicted pragma. In our evaluation on the PolyBench suite, we observe an increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragma generated using the optimized prompts compared to those annotated using the simpler initial prompt, particularly for the \"nano\"-scale models. Specifically, with optimized prompts, the compilation success rate for GPT-4.1 Nano surged from 66.7% to 93.3%, and for GPT-5 Nano improved from 86.7% to 100%, matching or surpassing the capabilities of their significantly larger, more expensive versions. Beyond compilation, the optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs that achieve functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines.

EZInput employs a declarative specification system where developers define input requirements and validation constraints once; the library then handles environment detection, interface rendering, parameter validation, and session persistence across Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, and terminal environments. This \"write once, run anywhere\" architecture enables researchers to prototype in notebooks and deploy identical parameter configurations for batch execution on remote systems without code changes or manual transcription. Parameter persistence, inspired by ImageJ/FIJI and adapted to Python workflows, saves and restores user configurations via lightweight YAML files, eliminating redundant input and producing shareable records that enhance reproducibility.

Decades of work has helped harden C code against attackers, but C projects do not consist of only C code. C projects also contain build system code for automating development tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging. These build systems are critcal to software supply chain security and vulnerable to being poisoned, with the XZ Utils and SolarWinds attacks being recent examples. Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack.

They produce inconsistent results when executed multiple times on the same code, invalidating the assumption that a test failure indicates a software defect. Recent work on LLM-based test generation has identified flakiness as a potential problem with generated tests. However, its prevalence and underlying causes are unclear. We examined the flakiness of LLM-generated tests in the context of four relational database management systems: SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite. We amplified test suites with two LLMs, GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, to assess the flakiness of the generated test cases. Our results suggest that generated tests have a slightly higher proportion of flaky tests compared to existing tests. Based on a manual inspection, we found that the most common root cause of flakiness was the reliance of a test on a certain order that is not guaranteed (\"unordered collection\"), which was present in 72 of 115 flaky tests (63%). Furthermore, both LLMs transferred the flakiness from the existing tests to the newly generated tests via the provided prompt context. Our experiments suggest that flakiness transfer is more prevalent in closed-source systems such as SAP HANA than in open-source systems.

It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS. It generates 20635 test cases and detects 520 hazardous behaviors, grouped into 15 root causes through manual analysis.

This process is challenging because such bugs are non-deterministic, and bug reports often lack the detailed information needed. Additionally, the unstructured nature of reports written in natural language makes it difficult to extract necessary details. Existing tools are inadequate to reproduce these bugs due to their inability to manage the specific interleaving at the system call level. To address these challenges, we propose SysPro, a novel approach that automatically extracts relevant system call names from bug reports and identifies their locations in the source code. It generates input data by utilizing information retrieval, regular expression matching, and the category-partition method. This extracted input and interleaving data are then used to reproduce bugs through dynamic source code instrumentation.

However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries). We also observe that the granularity at which the plain LLM is applied has a significant impact on the cost. We therefore propose targeting first the program classes, where test generation is more efficient, and then the uncovered methods to reduce the number of LLM requests. This strategy achieves comparable (slightly higher) effectiveness while requiring about 20% fewer LLM requests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u7248\u672c\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u53d8\u5f02\u5206\u6570\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u56db\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5148\u9488\u5bf9\u7c7b\u518d\u8865\u5145\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea620%\u7684LLM\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u5e38\u4e0e\u8fc7\u65f6\u57fa\u7ebf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30\u5176\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u66f4\u5f3aLLM\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u590d\u73b0\u56db\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\uff08HITS\u3001SymPrompt\u3001TestSpark\u3001CoverUp\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728393\u4e2a\u7c7b\u30013657\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u4e0e\u7eafLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7eafLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff08+17.72%\uff09\u3001\u5206\u652f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff08+19.80%\uff09\u3001\u53d8\u5f02\u5206\u6570\uff08+20.92%\uff09\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u8fd1\uff1b\u6309\u7c7b\u4f18\u5148\u751f\u6210\u518d\u8865\u6f0f\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u51cf\u5c1120%\u8bf7\u6c42\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u80fd\u529b\u5df2\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u9ad8\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u672a\u5fc5\u5fc5\u8981\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u7528\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShortCoder\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5\u7b80\u5316\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eAST\u7684Python\u8bed\u6cd5\u7b80\u5316\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u53ca\u7cbe\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6784\u5efaShorterCodeBench\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728HumanEval\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534718.1%-37.8%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4ee3\u7801\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ShortCoder\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
