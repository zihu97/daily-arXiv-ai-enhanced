However, unsynchronized transmitters and receivers fundamentally preclude phase-coherent radar-like delay--Doppler analysis. By exploiting the line-of-sight (LoS) path, i.e., the earliest-arriving direct path, as an over-the-air (OTA) reference for delay and phase, we propose an OTA LoS-path referencing scheme, termed LoSRef, that enables delay calibration and phase alignment in unsynchronized Wi-Fi systems. Unlike conventional Wi-Fi bistatic radar systems that rely on wired reference signals or dedicated reference antennas, the proposed LoSRef-based framework bridges the long-standing gap between conventional Wi-Fi sensing and Wi-Fi radar, enabling phase-coherent bistatic radar-like operation in a drop-in Wi-Fi sensing configuration. Through human gait and respiration experiments in indoor environments, we demonstrate that phase-coherent channel impulse responses and corresponding delay--Doppler responses are obtained using only commodity Wi-Fi devices. This enables physically interpretable human motion sensing, including gait-induced range variation and respiration-induced sub-wavelength displacement, as well as the extraction of target-induced dynamics up to 20 dB weaker than dominant static multipath components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLoSRef\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u7ebfLoSpath\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u975e\u540c\u6b65Wi-Fi\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u4f4d\u76f8\u5e72\u96f7\u8fbe\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5", "motivation": "\u975e\u540c\u6b65\u6536\u53d1\u7aef\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u4f4d\u76f8\u5e72\u65f6\u5ef6-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86Wi-Fi\u4f20\u611f\u5728\u4eba\u4f53\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6700\u65e9\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u89c6\u8ddd\u8def\u5f84(LoS)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1OTA LoSRef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ef6\u65f6\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u5bf9\u9f50", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u67b6\u8d77\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfWi-Fi\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534720dB\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5", "result": "Result analysis unavailable"}}

Our evaluation shows that, at 2 MB capacity, the embodied carbon per unit area overhead of HZO-FeFETs can be up to 11% higher than the CMOS baseline, while the embodied carbon per MB remains consistently about 4.3x lower than SRAM across different memory capacity.

The Workflows Community Summit 2025, held in Amsterdam on June 6th, 2025, convened international experts to examine emerging challenges and opportunities in this domain. Participants identified key barriers to workflow adoption, including tensions between system generality and domain-specific utility, concerns over long-term sustainability of workflow systems and services, insufficient recognition for those who develop and maintain reproducible workflows, and gaps in standardization, funding, training, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address these challenges, the summit proposed action lines spanning technology, policy, and community dimensions: shifting evaluation metrics from raw computational performance toward measuring genuine scientific impact; formalizing workflow patterns and community-driven benchmarks to improve transparency, reproducibility, and usability; cultivating a cohesive international workflows community that engages funding bodies and research stakeholders; and investing in human capital through dedicated workflow engineering roles, career pathways, and integration of workflow concepts into educational curricula and long-term training initiatives.

As a result, journey objectives (e.g., \"checkout p99 < 400 ms\") are often maintained outside code and drift as the system evolves, forcing teams to either miss user expectations or over-provision and gate releases with ad-hoc heuristics. We propose Emergence-as-Code (EmaC), a vision for making journey reliability computable and governable via intent plus evidence. An EmaC spec declares journey intent (objective, control-flow operators, allowed actions) and binds it to atomic SLOs and telemetry. A runtime inference component consumes operational artifacts (e.g., tracing and traffic configuration) to synthesize a candidate journey model with provenance and confidence. From the last accepted model, the EmaC compiler/controller derives bounded journey SLOs and budgets under explicit correlation assumptions (optimistic independence vs. pessimistic shared fate), and emits control-plane artifacts (burn-rate alerts, rollout gates, action guards) that are reviewable in a Git workflow.

Unfortunately, hardware TEEs can be subject to (rare) attacks, undermining the very guarantees that distributed ledgers are carefully designed to achieve. In response, we present Proteus, a new distributed consensus protocol that cautiously trusts the guarantees of TEEs. Proteus carefully embeds a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocol inside of a CFT protocol with no additional messages.

But what exactly does this quadratic cost pay for? Even the minimal requirement that every correct processor \\emph{receive at least one message} already necessitates $\u03a9(f^2 + n)$ messages. This raises a fundamental question: is the Dolev-Reischuk bound about the difficulty of \\emph{reaching univalency} -- the point at which the protocol's outcome is determined -- or merely about \\emph{disseminating} the outcome to all processors afterward?\n  We resolve this question by showing that reaching univalency does \\emph{not} require quadratic communication. Specifically, we introduce $\u03b5$-BA, a relaxation allowing an $\u03b5$-fraction of correct processors to output incorrectly, and prove it can be solved deterministically with $O(n \\log n)$ communication complexity when $f < n(1/3 - \u03b5)$. Crucially, any $\u03b5$-BA protocol can serve as the first phase of a full BA protocol: after $\u03b5$-BA, a single all-to-all exchange and majority vote completes BA. Since the outcome is already determined after $\u03b5$-BA, this demonstrates that the quadratic cost in Dolev-Reischuk stems entirely from dissemination, rather than from reaching univalency. We also define Extractable BA for authenticated settings, capturing when processors collectively hold enough signed messages to determine the agreed value, and show it can be solved with communication complexity $O(f \\log f)$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u53cd\u9a73Dolev-Reischuk\u4e0b\u754c\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e8c\u6b21\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u6e90\u4e8e\u4f20\u64ad\u9636\u6bb5\u800c\u975e\u8fbe\u6210\u5171\u8bc6\u51b3\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5355\u503c\u6027\u8fbe\u6210\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f84\u6e05Dolev-Reischuk\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u03a9\u7535\u573a\u00b2 + n\u6d88\u606f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5230\u5e95\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u8fbe\u6210\u534f\u8bae\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u5355\u503c\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u4e4b\u540e\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u4f20\u64ad\u7ed9\u6240\u6709\u5904\u7406\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u03b5-BA\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5c11\u6570\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u5668\u51fa\u9519\uff08\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u03b5\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6570f < n(1/3 - \u03b5)\u65f6\u4ee5O(n log n)\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49Extractable BA\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u8ba4\u8bc1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0O(f log f)\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "result": "\u03b5-BA\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6574BA\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u8fbe\u6210\u5355\u503c\u6027\uff08\u7ed3\u679c\u5df2\u51b3\u5b9a\uff09\uff0c\u4e8c\u6b21\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u5168\u7f51\u5e7f\u64ad\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b\u8bc1\u660eExtractable BA\u7684\u8f83\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Dolev-Reischuk\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u5b8c\u5168\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e}}{\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5171\u8bc6\u51b3\u5b9a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This limited view of testing leads to failures in model integration, deployment, and operations. In traditional software development, quality models such as ISO 25010 provide a widely used structured framework to assess software quality, define quality requirements, and provide a common language for communication with stakeholders. A newer standard, ISO 25059, defines a more specific quality model for AI systems. However, a problem with this standard is that it combines system attributes with ML component attributes, which is not helpful for a model developer, as many system attributes cannot be assessed at the component level. In this paper, we present a quality model for ML components that serves as a guide for requirements elicitation and negotiation and provides a common vocabulary for ML component developers and system stakeholders to agree on and define system-derived requirements and focus their testing efforts accordingly. The quality model was validated through a survey in which the participants agreed with its relevance and value.

Ideally, good test suites should test both normal and exceptional behaviors to catch more bugs and avoid regressions. While current research analyzes exceptions that propagate to tests, it does not explore other exceptions that do not reach the tests. In this paper, we provide an empirical study to explore how frequently exceptional behaviors are tested in real-world systems. We consider both exceptions that propagate to tests and the ones that do not reach the tests. For this purpose, we run an instrumented version of test suites, monitor their execution, and collect information about the exceptions raised at runtime. We analyze the test suites of 25 Python systems, covering 5,372 executed methods, 17.9M calls, and 1.4M raised exceptions. We find that 21.4% of the executed methods do raise exceptions at runtime. In methods that raise exceptions, on the median, 1 in 10 calls exercise exceptional behaviors. Close to 80% of the methods that raise exceptions do so infrequently, but about 20% raise exceptions more frequently. Finally, we provide implications for researchers and practitioners. We suggest developing novel tools to support exercising exceptional behaviors and refactoring expensive try/except blocks.

While QM components are not typically classified as safety-relevant, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) integration reveal that such components can contribute to SOTIF-related hazardous risks. Compliance with emerging AI safety standards, such as ISO/PAS 8800, necessitates re-evaluating safety considerations for these components. This paper examines the necessity of conducting holistic safety analysis and risk assessment on AI components, emphasizing their potential to introduce hazards with the capacity to violate risk acceptance criteria when deployed in safety-critical driving systems, particularly in perception algorithms. Using case studies, we demonstrate how deficiencies in AI-driven perception systems can emerge even in QM-classified components, leading to unintended functional behaviors with critical safety implications. By bridging theoretical analysis with practical examples, this paper argues for the adoption of comprehensive FuSa, SOTIF, and AI standards-driven methodologies to identify and mitigate risks in AI components.

While existing initiatives address governance, compliance, and security in isolation, they provide limited guidance on how sovereignty can be operationalized at the architectural level. In this paper, we argue that sovereignty must be treated as a first-class architectural property rather than a purely regulatory objective. We introduce a Sovereign Reference Architecture that integrates self-sovereign identity, blockchain-based trust and auditability, sovereign data governance, and Generative AI deployed under explicit architectural control. The architecture explicitly captures the dual role of Generative AI as both a source of governance risk and an enabler of compliance, accountability, and continuous assurance when properly constrained. By framing sovereignty as an architectural quality attribute, our work bridges regulatory intent and concrete system design, offering a coherent foundation for building auditable, evolvable, and jurisdiction-aware AI-enabled systems.

Validating patches against their intended semantics is difficult due to incomplete regression tests and informal, non-executable natural language (NL) descriptions of patch intent. We present PatchGuru, the first automated technique that infers executable patch specifications from real-world pull requests (PRs). Given a PR, PatchGuru uses large language models (LLMs) to extract developer intent from NL artifacts and synthesizes patch oracles: under-approximate yet practical specifications expressed as runtime assertions in comparison programs that integrate pre- and post-patch versions. Patch oracles focus on patch-relevant behaviors, enable automated validation, and support cross-version properties. PatchGuru iteratively refines inferred oracles by comparing pre- and post-patch behaviors, identifies violations, filters inconsistencies via self-review, and generates bug reports. We evaluate PatchGuru on 400 recent PRs from four widely used open-source Python projects. PatchGuru reports 39 warnings with a precision of 0.62, yielding 24 confirmed true positives, including 12 previously unknown bugs, 11 of which were subsequently fixed by developers. Compared to the state-of-the-art technique Testora, PatchGuru detects 17 more bugs (24 vs. 7) while improving precision from 0.32 to 0.62.

In recent years, the fuzzing process has been integrated into continuous integration workflows (i.e., continuous fuzzing), enabling short and frequent testing cycles. Despite its widespread adoption, prior research has not examined whether the effectiveness of continuous fuzzing varies across programming languages. This study conducts a large-scale cross-language analysis to examine how fuzzing bug characteristics and detection efficiency differ among languages. We analyze 61,444 fuzzing bugs and 999,248 builds from 559 OSS-Fuzz projects categorized by primary language. Our findings reveal that (i) C++ and Rust exhibit higher fuzzing bug detection frequencies, (ii) Rust and Python show low vulnerability ratios but tend to expose more critical vulnerabilities, (iii) crash types vary across languages and unreproducible bugs are more frequent in Go but rare in Rust, and (iv) Python attains higher patch coverage but suffers from longer time-to-detection.

They interfere with automated quality assurance of code changes and hinder efficient software testing. Previous work evaluated approaches to train machine learning models to classify flaky tests based on identifiers in the test code. However, the resulting classifiers have been shown to lack generalizability, hindering their applicability in practical environments. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the capability to generalize across various tasks. Thus, they represent a promising approach to address the generalizability problem of previous approaches. In this study, we evaluated three LLMs (two general-purpose models, one code-specific model) using three prompting techniques on two benchmark datasets from prior studies on flaky test classification. Furthermore, we manually investigated 50 samples from the given datasets to determine whether classifying flaky tests based only on test code is feasible for humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to classify flaky tests given only the test code. The results of our best prompt-model combination were only marginally better than random guessing. In our manual analysis, we found that the test code does not necessarily contain sufficient information for a flakiness classification.

ArkTS repositories are crawled from GitHub and Gitee, and comment-function pairs are extracted using tree-sitter-arkts, followed by cross-platform deduplication and statistical analysis of ArkTS function types.

Understanding and reducing the energy footprint of LLM inference is therefore essential for sustainable software development. Objective: In this study, we conduct a phase-level analysis of LLM inference energy consumption, distinguishing between the (1) prefill, where the model processes the input and builds internal representations, and (2) decoding, where output tokens are generated using the stored state. Method: We investigate six 6B-7B and four 3B-4B transformer-based models, evaluating them on code-centric benchmarks HumanEval for code generation and LongBench for code understanding. Results: Our findings show that, within both parameter groups, models exhibit distinct energy patterns across phases. Furthermore, we observed that increases in prefill cost amplify the energy cost per token during decoding, with amplifications ranging from 1.3% to 51.8% depending on the model. Lastly, three out of ten models demonstrate babbling behavior, adding excessive content to the output that unnecessarily inflates energy consumption. We implemented babbling suppression for code generation, achieving energy savings ranging from 44% to 89% without affecting generation accuracy. Conclusion: These findings show that prefill costs influence decoding, which dominates energy consumption, and that babbling suppression can yield up to 89% energy savings. Reducing inference energy therefore requires both mitigating babbling behavior and limiting impact of prefill on decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u5145\u503c\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u6a21\u5f0f\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9884\u5145\u503c\u6210\u672c\u653e\u5927\u89e3\u7801\u80fd\u8017\uff1b\u6291\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5570\u55e6\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8282\u7701\u6700\u591a89%\u80fd\u6e90\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "AI\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5f00\u53d1", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u6b3e6B-7B\u548c\u56db\u6b3e3B-4B\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5728HumanEval\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548cLongBench\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9884\u51fa\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u4e24\u79cd\u9636\u6bb5", "result": "\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u72ec\u7279\u80fd\u8017\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9884\u5145\u503c\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u4f7f\u89e3\u7801\u671f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u80fd\u8017\u653e\u59271.3%-51.8%\uff1b\u5341\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\u5570\u55e6\u5185\u5bb9\u589e\u52a0\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u540e\u8282\u7ea644%-89%\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u51c6\u786e", "conclusion": "\u9884\u5145\u503c\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e3b\u5bfc\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u5570\u55e6\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8282\u7701\u9ad8\u8fbe89%\u80fd\u6e90\uff1b\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u5570\u55e6\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u9650\u5236\u9884\u5145\u503c\u5f71\u54cd"}}

Despite the increased performance of LLMs on public benchmarks, out of the box LLMs still have a hard time generating code that aligns with a private code repository not previously seen by the model's training data. Customizing code LLMs to a private repository provides a way to improve the model performance. In this paper we present our approach for automated LLM customization based on semantic scopes in the code. We evaluate LLMs on real industry cases with two private enterprise code repositories with two customization strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and supervised Fine-Tuning (FT). Our mechanism for ingesting the repository's data and formulating the training data pairs with semantic scopes helps models to learn the underlying patterns specific to the repository, providing more precise code to developers and helping to boost their productivity. The code completions of moderately sized customized models can be significantly better than those of uncustomized models of much larger capacity.

However, these ratings are often reported without critical experimental details, leading to significant discrepancies illustrated by recent reports where the score of the same model version fluctuated by nearly 500 points. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on the hidden factors biasing Elo evaluations: (1) the temporal ordering of submissions, (2) contest difficulty selection, and (3) run to run stochastic variability of LLMs. Utilizing a controlled benchmark of 37 recent Codeforces contests and 13,691 generated test cases, we demonstrate that Elo scores are highly sensitive to these parameters. Our findings reveal that varying submission orders can shift scores by 394 points, while contest selection can cause differences of up to 1,122 points for the same model. Run to run performance exhibits substantial instability, with a maximum difference of 349 points in mean scores observed when evaluating identical contests. We conclude that direct Elo comparisons are unreliable and potentially misleading without strict standardization and transparent reporting of experimental settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793aCodeforces\u7684Elo\u8bc4\u5206\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\u7f16\u7a0b\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u6570\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "Elo\u8bc4\u5206\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ec6\u8282\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5f15\u8d77\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6570\u6ce2\u52a8\u8fbe500\u70b9\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u9690\u85cf\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e37\u573aCodeforces\u6bd4\u8d5b\u548c13,691\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4ea4\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u6bd4\u8d5b\u96be\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8fd9\u4e09\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6570\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff1a\u63d0\u4ea4\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u79fb394\u5206\uff0c\u6bd4\u8d5b\u9009\u62e9\u5dee\u5f02\u8fbe1122\u5206\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5206\u6570\u5dee349\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "Elo\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u6613\u8bef\u5bfc\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e76\u900f\u660e\u62a5\u544a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u4fe1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}
