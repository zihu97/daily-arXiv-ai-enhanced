Although training is energy-intensive, the long-term environmental burden arises from inference, amplified by the massive global query volume. Cloud-based inference offers scalability but suffers from latency and bandwidth constraints due to centralized processing and continuous data transfer. Edge clusters instead can mitigate these limitations by enabling localized execution, yet they face trade-offs between performance, energy efficiency, and device constraints. This short paper presents a sustainability-aware LLM inference for edge clusters comprising NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX (8GB) and Nvidia Ada 2000 (16GB) devices. It aims to balance inference latency and carbon footprint through carbon- and latency-aware routing strategies, guided by empirical benchmarking of energy consumption and execution time across diverse prompts and batch (i.e., group of prompts) configurations. We compared baseline greedy strategies to carbon-aware and latency-aware strategies in prompt routing to specific hardware based on benchmarking information. Experimental evaluation shows that a batch size of four prompts achieves a trade-off between throughput, energy efficiency, while larger batches risk GPU memory saturation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u8fb9\u7f18\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027LLM\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728NVIDIA Jetson\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u957f\u671f\u73af\u5883\u8d1f\u62c5\u4e0e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u514b\u670d\u4e91\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eNVIDIA Jetson Orin NX\u4e0eAda 2000\u8bbe\u5907\u6784\u5efa\u8fb9\u7f18\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6279\u6b21\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u78b3\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6279\u5904\u7406\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a4\u65f6\u53ef\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u6279\u6b21\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4GPU\u5185\u5b58\u9971\u548c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u78b3\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

However, its performance and stability depend heavily on factors such as startup overhead, runtime execution model (e.g., Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation), and resource variability across deployment contexts. This paper evaluates a Wasm-based serverless workflow executed consistently from the browser to edge and cloud instances. The setup uses wasm32-wasi modules: in the browser, execution occurs within a web worker, while on Edge and Cloud, an HTTP shim streams frames to the Wasm runtime. We measure cold- and warm-start latency, per-step delays, workflow makespan, throughput, and CPU/memory utilization to capture the end-to-end behavior across environments. Results show that AOT compilation and instance warming substantially reduce startup latency. For workflows with small payloads, the browser achieves competitive performance owing to fully in-memory data exchanges.

The system must offer guarantees like ordering and at-least-once delivery while avoiding overload on consumers, allowing them to consume messages at their own pace.\n  This paper presents the design of Fast ACS (an abbreviation for Ads Copy Service), a file-based ordered message delivery system that leverages a combination of two-sided (inter-cluster) and one-sided (intra-cluster) communication primitives - namely, Remote Procedure Call and Remote Memory Access, respectively - to deliver messages. The system has been successfully deployed to dozens of production clusters and scales to accommodate several thousand consumers within each cluster, which amounts to Tbps-scale intra-cluster consumer traffic at peak.

Yet despite rapid progress in code generation, today's Large Language Models (LLMs) are rarely tested on this kind of forward-looking reasoning. We close that gap with gpuFLOPBench, a benchmark that asks models to \"count without running\" by predicting single and double-precision FLOP counts for 577 CUDA kernels drawn from HeCBench, annotated with ground-truth profiles and eight execution attributes that distinguish trivially analyzable code from kernels whose FLOPs depend on hidden compiler or runtime behavior. Evaluating current closed-source reasoning models shows clear but uneven progress: the newest LLMs achieve perfect classification on straightforward kernels but still incur multiple order-of-magnitude errors whenever implicit FLOPs arise from division, intrinsic math functions, or common subexpressions. These results surface a core limitation of existing code assistants -- the inability to internalize hardware-specific microcode effects -- and position gpuFLOPBench as a focused testbed for developing LLM tooling that can reason about performance with the same rigor as experienced GPU developers.

However, many libraries are not designed with composition in mind and assume they have exclusive access to all resources.

Prior solutions involve modifying the libraries or the OS, which is often infeasible.\n  We propose Virtual Library Contexts (VLCs), which are process subunits that encapsulate sets of libraries and associated resource allocations. VLCs control the resource utilization of these libraries without modifying library code. This enables the user to partition resources between libraries to prevent contention, or load multiple copies of the same library to allow parallel execution of otherwise thread-unsafe code within the same process.\n  In this paper, we describe and evaluate C++ and Python prototypes of VLCs.

However, its effectiveness depends heavily on the selection and quality of in-context examples, particularly in complex domains. In this work, we examine retrieval-augmented prompting as a strategy to improve few-shot performance in code vulnerability detection, where the goal is to identify one or more security-relevant weaknesses present in a given code snippet from a predefined set of vulnerability categories. We perform a systematic evaluation using the Gemini-1.5-Flash model across three approaches: (1) standard few-shot prompting with randomly selected examples, (2) retrieval-augmented prompting using semantically similar examples, and (3) retrieval-based labeling, which assigns labels based on retrieved examples without model inference. Our results show that retrieval-augmented prompting consistently outperforms the other prompting strategies. At 20 shots, it achieves an F1 score of 74.05% and a partial match accuracy of 83.90%. We further compare this approach against zero-shot prompting and several fine-tuned models, including Gemini-1.5-Flash and smaller open-source models such as DistilBERT, DistilGPT2, and CodeBERT. Retrieval-augmented prompting outperforms both zero-shot (F1 score: 36.35%, partial match accuracy: 20.30%) and fine-tuned Gemini (F1 score: 59.31%, partial match accuracy: 53.10%), while avoiding the training time and cost associated with model fine-tuning.

However, accurate channel estimation in THz frequencies presents significant challenges due to factors such as high propagation losses, sensitivity to environmental obstructions, and strong atmospheric absorption. These challenges are particularly pronounced in urban environments, where traditional channel estimation methods often fail to deliver reliable results, particularly in complex non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. This paper introduces a novel vision-based channel estimation technique that integrates causal reasoning into urban THz communication systems. The proposed method combines computer vision algorithms with variational causal dynamics (VCD) to analyze real-time images of the urban environment, allowing for a deeper understanding of the physical factors that influence THz signal propagation. By capturing the complex, dynamic interactions between physical objects (such as buildings, trees, and vehicles) and the transmitted signals, the model can predict the channel with up to twice the accuracy of conventional methods. This model improves estimation accuracy and demonstrates superior generalization performance. Hence, it can provide reliable predictions even in previously unseen urban environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is particularly evident in NLoS conditions, where it significantly outperforms traditional methods such as by accounting for indirect signal paths, such as reflections and diffractions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed vision-based approach surpasses conventional artificial intelligence (AI)-based estimation techniques in accuracy and robustness, showing a substantial improvement across various dynamic urban scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u590d\u6742\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u901a\u4fe1\u57286G\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u4f20\u64ad\u635f\u8017\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u654f\u611f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57ce\u5e02NLoS\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u53d8\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08VCD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u65f6\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728NLoS\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u4f18\u5f02\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709AI\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -- processes vs. distributions -- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation. The framework is validated using the same elder-caregiver ABM dataset introduced in the companion paper, and we provide precise definitions and propositions formalizing the mathematical complementarity between $\u03b5$-machines and diffusion models.

However, existing evaluation systems, neither traditional tests for humans nor benchmarks for LLMs, fail to capture this shift. They remain focused on well-defined algorithmic problems, which excludes problems where success depends on human-AI collaboration. Such collaborative problems not only require human reasoning to interpret complex contexts and guide solution strategies, but also demand AI efficiency for implementation. To bridge this gap, we introduce HAI-Eval, a unified benchmark designed to measure the synergy of human-AI partnership in coding. HAI-Eval's core innovation is its \"Collaboration-Necessary\" problem templates, which are intractable for both standalone LLMs and unaided humans, but solvable through effective collaboration. Specifically, HAI-Eval uses 45 templates to dynamically create tasks. It also provides a standardized IDE for human participants and a reproducible toolkit with 450 task instances for LLMs, ensuring an ecologically valid evaluation. We conduct a within-subject study with 45 participants and benchmark their performance against 5 state-of-the-art LLMs under 4 different levels of human intervention. Results show that standalone LLMs and unaided participants achieve poor pass rates (0.67% and 18.89%), human-AI collaboration significantly improves performance to 31.11%. Our analysis reveals an emerging co-reasoning partnership. This finding challenges the traditional human-tool hierarchy by showing that strategic breakthroughs can originate from either humans or AI. HAI-Eval establishes not only a challenging benchmark for next-generation coding agents but also a grounded, scalable framework for assessing core developer competencies in the AI era.

Depending on the type of twinning occurring, it is either trivial, such as in dashboarding/visualizations that mirror the system with real-time data, or challenging, in case the digital twin is a simulation model that reflects the behavior of a physical twinned system. The challenge in this latter case comes from the fact that in contrast to software systems, physical systems are not immutable once deployed, but instead they evolve through processes like maintenance, wear and tear or user error. It is therefore important to detect when changes occur in the physical system to evolve the twin alongside it. We employ and reuse validation techniques from model-based design for this goal. Model validation is one of the steps used to gain trust in the representativeness of a simulation model. In this work, we provide two contributions: (i) we provide a generic approach that, through the use of validation metrics, is able to detect anomalies in twinned systems, and (ii) we demonstrate these techniques with the help of an academic yet industrially relevant case study of a gantry crane such as found in ports. Treating anomalies also means correcting the error in the digital twin, which we do with a parameter estimation based on the historical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6307\u6807\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fee\u6b63\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u4f1a\u56e0\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u78e8\u635f\u6216\u4eba\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u800c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u53ca\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u540c\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u590d\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6307\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u4fee\u6b63\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e2f\u53e3\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u9f99\u95e8\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u6301\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Investigation processes followed by on-call engineers are often manual or rely on ad-hoc scripts. This leads to inefficient investigations resulting in increased time to mitigate and isolate failures/SLO violations. It also contributes to on-call toil and poor productivity leading to multiple hours/days spent in triaging/debugging incidents. In this paper, we present DrP, an end-to-end framework and system to automate investigations that reduces the mean time to resolve incidents (MTTR) and reduces on-call toil. DrP consists of an expressive and flexible SDK to author investigation playbooks in code (called analyzers), a scalable backend system to execute these automated playbooks, plug-ins to integrate playbooks into mainstream workflows such as alerts and incident management tools, and a post-processing system to take actions on investigations including mitigation steps.\n  We have implemented and deployed DrP at large scale at Meta covering 300+ teams, 2000+ analyzers, across a large set of use cases across domains such as services, core infrastructure, AI/ML, hardware, mobile. DrP has been running in production for the past 5 years and executes 50K automated analyses per day. Overall, our results and experience show that DrP has been able to reduce average MTTR by 20 percent at large scale (with over 80 percent for some teams) and has significantly improved on-call productivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "DrP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8c03\u67e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u5668\u548c\u540e\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u51cf\u5c11\u6545\u969c\u5e73\u5747\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\uff08MTTR\uff09\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u7ef4\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u591a\u4e3a\u624b\u52a8\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e34\u65f6\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u589e\u52a0\u8fd0\u7ef4\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDrP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bSDK\u7f16\u5199\u5206\u6790\u5668\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u3001\u63d2\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u544a\u8b66\u4e0e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u4e8b\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728Meta\u90e8\u7f725\u5e74\uff0c\u8986\u76d6300+\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u65e5\u5747\u6267\u884c5\u4e07\u6b21\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e73\u5747MTTR\u964d\u4f4e20%\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u56e2\u961f\u8fbe80%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u7ef4\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DrP\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u8c03\u67e5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u5316\u6545\u969c\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8fd0\u7ef4\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u3002"}}

This study investigates how undergraduate SE students use GenAI tools, focusing on the benefits, challenges, ethical concerns, and instructional expectations that shape their experiences. Method. We conducted a survey with 130 undergraduate students from two universities. The survey combined structured Likert-scale items and open-ended questions to investigate five dimensions: usage context, perceived benefits, challenges, ethical and instructional perceptions. Results. Students most often use GenAI for incremental learning and advanced implementation, reporting benefits such as brainstorming support and confidence-building. At the same time, they face challenges including unclear rationales and difficulty adapting outputs. Students highlight ethical concerns around fairness and misconduct, and call for clearer instructional guidance. Conclusion. GenAI is reshaping SE education in nuanced ways.

However, regular 2D blocking on this non-uniform distribution structure may lead to workload imbalance across blocks. Besides, existing matrix features fail to guide us effectively in blocking. In this paper, we propose a structure-aware irregular blocking method for numerical factorization. A novel diagonal block-based feature is introduced to effectively characterize the local nonzero distribution of sparse matrices. Based on this, we further propose an irregular blocking method that adjusts block sizes according to the local distribution of nonzeros. The strategy utilizes fine-grained blocks in dense regions and coarse-grained blocks in sparse regions, adequately balancing the nonzeros of blocks both within the same level and across levels in the dependency tree. Experiments demonstrate that, on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, our proposed irregular blocking method achieves average speedups of 1.50x and 3.32x over PanguLU and the latest SuperLU_DIST, respectively.

DOI: 10.1109/VL-HCC65237.2025.00024", "summary": "Usability evaluations are essential for ensuring that modern interfaces meet user needs, yet traditional heuristic evaluations by human experts can be time-consuming and subjective, especially early in development. This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can provide reliable and consistent heuristic assessments at the development stage. By applying Jakob Nielsen's ten usability heuristics to thirty open-source websites, we generated over 850 heuristic evaluations in three independent evaluations per site using a pipeline of OpenAI's GPT-4o. For issue detection, the model demonstrated moderate consistency, with an average pairwise Cohen's Kappa of 0.50 and an exact agreement of 84%. Severity judgments showed more variability: weighted Cohen's Kappa averaged 0.63, but exact agreement was just 56%, and Krippendorff's Alpha was near zero. These results suggest that while GPT-4o can produce internally consistent evaluations, especially for identifying the presence of usability issues, its ability to judge severity varies and requires human oversight in practice. Our findings highlight the feasibility and limitations of using LLMs for early-stage, automated usability testing, and offer a foundation for improving consistency in automated User Experience (UX) evaluation.

The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems.

This paper bridges this gap by developing a multicarrier stochastic framework that explicitly couples local gradient updates with frequency-selective THz effects, including beam squint, molecular absorption, and jitter. Our analysis uncovers a critical diversity trap: under standard unbiased aggregation, the convergence error floor is driven by the harmonic mean of subcarrier SNRs. Consequently, a single spectral hole caused by severe beam squint can render the entire bandwidth useless for reliable model updates. We further identify a fundamental bandwidth limit, revealing that expanding the spectrum beyond a critical point degrades convergence due to the integration of thermal noise and gain collapse at band edges. Finally, we demonstrate that an SNR-weighted aggregation strategy is necessary to suppress the variance singularity at these spectral holes, effectively recovering convergence in high-squint regimes where standard averaging fails.

While existing research benchmarks functional correctness (pass@k), this study presents the first empirical framework to measure \"Architectural Erosion\" and the accumulation of Technical Debt in AI-synthesized microservices. We conducted a comparative pilot study of three state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3 8B) by prompting them to implement a standardized Book Lending Microservice under strict Hexagonal Architecture constraints. Utilizing Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing, we find that while proprietary models achieve high architectural conformance (0% violation rate for GPT-5.1), open-weights models exhibit critical divergence. Specifically, Llama 3 demonstrated an 80% Architectural Violation Rate, frequently bypassing interface adapters to create illegal circular dependencies between Domain and Infrastructure layers. Furthermore, we identified a phenomenon of \"Implementation Laziness,\" where open-weights models generated 60% fewer Logical Lines of Code (LLOC) than their proprietary counterparts, effectively omitting complex business logic to satisfy token constraints.

Yet, large-scale repositories inevitably introduce noisy or mislabeled examples that degrade both accuracy and robustness. While Noise Label Learning (NLL) has been extensively studied in other fields, there are a few works that investigate NLL in Software Engineering (SE) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for SE tasks. In this work, we propose MANTRA, a Multi-stage Adaptive Noise TReAtment framework that embeds noise diagnosis and mitigation directly into the fine-tuning process of code-Pretrained Language Models (PTM) and code-LLMs. We first investigate the effect of noise at varying levels on convergence and loss trajectories of the models. Then we apply an adaptive dropout strategy guided by per-sample loss dynamics and Gaussian Mixture Model clustering to exclude persistently noisy points while preserving clean data. Applying to code summarization and commit intent classification, our experiments reveal that some LLMs are more sensitive to noise than others. However, with MANTRA, the performance of all models in both tasks is improved. MANTRA enables researchers and practitioners to reduce the impact of errors introduced by the dataset in training, saves time in data cleaning and processing, while maximizing the effect of fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MANTRA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u542b\u566a\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e38\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6b64\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6MANTRA\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6837\u672c\u635f\u5931\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5254\u9664\u6301\u7eed\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u6458\u8981\u548c\u63d0\u4ea4\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cMANTRA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u7c7bLLM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u8282\u7701\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "MANTRA\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

First, most fuzzers use optimization pipelines (heuristics-based, fixed sequences of passes) as their harness. The phase-ordering problem can enable or preempt transformations, so pipelines inevitably miss optimization interactions; moreover, many optimizations are not scheduled, even at aggressive levels. Second, optimizations typically fire only when inputs satisfy specific structural relationships, which existing generators and mutations struggle to produce. We propose targeted fuzzing of individual optimizations to complement pipeline-based testing. Our key idea is to exploit composition styles - structural relations over program constructs (adjacency, nesting, repetition, ordering) - that optimizations look for. We build a general-purpose, grammar-based mutational fuzzer, TargetFuzz, that (i) mines composition styles from an optimization-relevant corpus, then (ii) rebuilds them inside different contexts offered by a larger, generic corpus via synthesized mutations to test variations of optimization logic. TargetFuzz is adaptable to a new programming language by lightweight, grammar-based, construct annotations - and it automatically synthesizes mutators and crossovers to rebuild composition styles. No need for hand-coded generators or language-specific mutators, which is particularly useful for modular frameworks such as MLIR, whose dialect-based, rapidly evolving ecosystem makes optimizations difficult to fuzz. Our evaluation on LLVM and MLIR shows that TargetFuzz improves coverage by 8% and 11% and triggers optimizations 2.8$\\times$ and 2.6$\\times$, compared to baseline fuzzers under the targeted fuzzing mode. We show that targeted fuzzing is complementary: it effectively tests all 37 sampled LLVM optimizations, while pipeline-fuzzing missed 12.", "AI": {"tldr": "TargetFuzz\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u89e6\u53d1\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6784\u9020\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u98ce\u683c\uff08\u5982\u90bb\u63a5\u3001\u5d4c\u5957\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u76f8\u5173\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u5e76\u91cd\u6784\u5230\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u6599\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u53d8\u5f02\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLVM\u548cMLIR\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cTargetFuzz\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5de5\u5177\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53478%\u548c11%\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u89e6\u53d1\u4f18\u5316\u6b21\u6570\u63d0\u9ad82.8\u500d\u548c2.6\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u670937\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9a\u5411\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u662f\u5bf9\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5982MLIR\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u5de5\u7f16\u5199\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u914d\u65b0\u8bed\u8a00\u3002"}}

It underpins anomaly detection, failure diagnosis, and other AIOps tasks. Current parsers are mostly reactive and log-centric. They only infer templates from logs, mostly overlooking the source code. This restricts their capacity to grasp dynamic log structures or adjust to evolving systems. Moreover, per-log LLM inference is too costly for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose LLM-SrcLog, a proactive and unified framework for log template parsing. It extracts templates directly from source code prior to deployment and supplements them with data-driven parsing for logs without available code. LLM-SrcLog integrates a cross-function static code analyzer to reconstruct meaningful logging contexts, an LLM-based white-box template extractor with post-processing to distinguish constants from variables, and a black-box template extractor that incorporates data-driven clustering for remaining unmatched logs. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Hadoop and Zookeeper) and a large-scale industrial system (Sunfire-Compute) show that, compared to two LLM-based baselines, LLM-SrcLog improves average F1-score by 2-17% and 8-35%. Meanwhile, its online parsing latency is comparable to data-driven methods and about 1,000 times faster than per-log LLM parsing. LLM-SrcLog achieves a near-ideal balance between speed and accuracy.

However, existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically treat code as plain natural language, relying primarily on shallow semantic matching while overlooking structural semantics and code-specific dependencies. This limits their ability to capture control flow and underlying intent, ultimately constraining the quality of generated code. Therefore, we propose CoCo, a novel framework that enables code Completion by Comprehension of multi-granularity context from large-scale code repositories. CoCo employs static code analysis to extract structured context at the function, file, and project levels, capturing execution logic and semantic dependencies. It then adopts an graph-based multi-granularity context selection mechanism to filter out redundant information and remove noise. Consequently, the information is converted into natural language in a consistent manner, thereby functioning as explicit contextual prompts to guide subsequent code completion. Additionally, a structure-aware code re-ranker mechanism ensures alignment at both semantic and structural levels. Extensive experiments on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 20.2% gains in EM.

Additionally, we analyze model behavior on the CoNaLa dataset for code explanation, comparing natural language and code-specialized LLMs. Our findings reveal that models optimized for code (e.g., CodeLLaMA variants) exhibit strong reasoning and syntactic precision, that even for non-coding tasks can show measurable performance gains, in contrast to general-purpose models like Mistral-7B and Llama-3-8B.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u4e13\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ea6\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u8865\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee3\u7801\u4e13\u7528LLM\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eCoNaLa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u7801\u89e3\u91ca\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u4ee3\u7801\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CodeLLaMA\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u975e\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Mistral-7B\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08GenAI\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08SASs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3aSAS\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u53ca\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dGenAI\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728SAS\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0e\u969c\u788d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u68b3\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u56db\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u6587\u732e\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa\u4e24\u5927\u7c7b\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51faGenAI\u53ef\u63d0\u5347SAS\u53cd\u9988\u73af\u5404\u73af\u8282\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6280\u672f\u77ed\u677f\u4e0e\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "GenAI\u4e3aSAS\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u514b\u670d\u6280\u672f\u9002\u914d\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Existing approaches, typically rule-driven controllers or isolated learning components, struggle to generalize to novel contexts or coordinate responses across distributed subsystems, leaving them ill-equipped for emergent unknown unknowns. Recent discussions on Self-Adaptation 2.0 emphasize an equal partnership between AI and adaptive systems, merging learning-driven intelligence with adaptive control for predictive and proactive behavior. Building on this foundation, we introduce POLARIS, a three-layer multi-agentic self-adaptation framework that advances beyond reactive adaptation. POLARIS integrates: (1) a low-latency Adapter layer for monitoring and safe execution, (2) a transparent Reasoning layer that generates and verifies plans using tool-aware, explainable agents, and (3) a Meta layer that records experiences and meta-learns improved adaptation policies over time. Through shared knowledge and predictive models, POLARIS handles uncertainty, learns from past actions, and evolves its strategies, enabling systems that anticipate change and maintain resilient, goal-directed behavior. Preliminary evaluation on two self-adaptive exemplars, SWIM and SWITCH, shows that POLARIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We argue this marks a shift toward Self-Adaptation 3.0, akin to Software 3.0: a paradigm where systems not only learn from their environment but also reason about and evolve their own adaptation processes, continuously improving to meet novel challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "POLARIS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u9002\u914d\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u5316\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u5e9e\u5927\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e92\u8054\u4e14\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u5b64\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPOLARIS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9002\u914d\u5c42\u3001\u900f\u660e\u63a8\u7406\u5c42\u548c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5c42\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5de5\u5177\u611f\u77e5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8ba1\u5212\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWIM\u548cSWITCH\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPOLARIS\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "POLARIS\u4ee3\u8868\u8fc8\u5411\u2018\u81ea\u9002\u5e943.0\u2019\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u4ece\u73af\u5883\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u66f4\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u672a\u77e5\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

We find 8 publicly available static analysis tools to be capable of detecting 8 of the 15 defect categories. We find that the highest precision and recall of those tools are for defects related to data fields. We develop a linter to detect two categories of defects that cause serious consequences, which none of the studied tools are able to detect.
