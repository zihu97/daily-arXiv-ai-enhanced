MoE models use sparse gating to\nactivate only a handful of expert sub-networks per input, achieving\nbillion-parameter capacity with inference costs akin to much smaller models.\nHowever, such models often pose challenges for hardware deployment due to the\nmassive data volume introduced by the MoE layers. To address the challenges of\nserving MoE models, we propose Stratum, a system-hardware co-design approach\nthat combines the novel memory technology Monolithic 3D-Stackable DRAM (Mono3D\nDRAM), near-memory processing (NMP), and GPU acceleration. The logic and Mono3D\nDRAM dies are connected through hybrid bonding, whereas the Mono3D DRAM stack\nand GPU are interconnected via silicon interposer. Mono3D DRAM offers higher\ninternal bandwidth than HBM thanks to the dense vertical interconnect pitch\nenabled by its monolithic structure, which supports implementations of\nhigher-performance near-memory processing. Furthermore, we tackle the latency\ndifferences introduced by aggressive vertical scaling of Mono3D DRAM along the\nz-dimension by constructing internal memory tiers and assigning data across\nlayers based on access likelihood, guided by topic-based expert usage\nprediction to boost NMP throughput.

The RK scheme has a smaller\nimpact on the code performance and a classical fourth-order scheme seems to\ngenerally be a good choice. The code performs very well on all considered GPUs.\nThe many-CPU performance is also very good and perfect weak scaling is observed\nup to many hundreds of CPU cores using MPI. We note that small grid-size\nsimulations are faster on CPUs than on GPUs while GPUs win significantly over\nCPUs for simulations involving more than $10^7$ degrees of freedom ($\\approx\n3100^2$ grid points). When it comes to the environmental impact of numerical\nsimulations we estimate that GPUs consume less energy than CPUs for large\ngrid-size simulations but more energy on small grids. We observe a tendency\nthat the more modern is the GPU the larger needs to be the grid in order to use\nit efficiently. This yields a rebound effect because larger simulations need\nlonger computing times and in turn more energy that is not compensated by the\nenergy efficiency gain of the newer GPUs."}

Using HR\ndata from 2016-2025 in Ericsson Sweden, we analyze how different work\nmodalities (onsite, remote, and hybrid) influence employee retention. Our\nfindings show a marked increase in resignations from summer 2021 to summer\n2023, especially among employees with less than five years of tenure. Employees\nonboarded remotely during the pandemic were significantly more likely to resign\nwithin their first three years, even after returning to the office. Exit\nsurveys suggest that remote onboarding may fail to establish the necessary\norganizational attachment, the feeling of belonging and long-term retention.

We develop a minimal\naxiomatic theory and prove four results: existence and uniqueness,\npolicy-agnostic invariance, observational equivalence, and axiom minimality.\nThese results show that DCS resolves causal ambiguities that value-centric\nconvergence models such as CRDTs cannot address, and that removing any axiom\ncollapses determinism into ambiguity.
