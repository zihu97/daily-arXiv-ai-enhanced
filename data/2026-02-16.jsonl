Introduces a multi-agent architecture for physics simulation code generation with perceptual self-reflection via vision-based validation. Includes qualitative evaluation across multiple physics domains", "summary": "We present a multi-agent framework for generating physics simulation code from natural language descriptions, featuring a novel perceptual self-reflection mechanism for validation. The system employs four specialized agents: a natural language interpreter that converts user requests into physics-based descriptions; a technical requirements generator that produces scaled simulation parameters; a physics code generator with automated self-correction; and a physics validator that implements perceptual self-reflection. The key innovation is perceptual validation, which analyzes rendered animation frames using a vision-capable language model rather than inspecting code structure directly. This approach addresses the ``oracle gap'' where syntactically correct code produces physically incorrect behavior--a limitation that conventional testing cannot detect. We evaluate the system across seven domains including classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, wave physics, reaction-diffusion systems, and non-physics data visualization. The perceptual self-reflection architecture demonstrates substantial improvement over single-shot generation baselines, with the majority of tested scenarios achieving target physics accuracy thresholds. The system exhibits robust pipeline stability with consistent code self-correction capability, operating at approximately \\$0.20 per animation. These results validate our hypothesis that feeding visual simulation outputs back to a vision-language model for iterative refinement significantly outperforms single-shot code generation for physics simulation tasks and highlights the potential of agentic AI to support engineering workflows and physics data generation pipelines."}

At the same time, generative artificial intelligence is reshaping development practice, offering powerful forms of assistance while introducing new challenges for accountability, reflection, and methodological rigour. Although Action Design Research (ADR) provides a well-established foundation for studying and constructing socio-technical artefacts, it offers limited guidance on how its principles can be operationalised in the day-to-day practice of solo, AI-assisted research software development. This paper proposes the SHAPR framework (Solo, Human-centred, AI-assisted PRactice) as a practice-level operational framework that complements ADR by translating its high-level principles into actionable guidance for contemporary research contexts. SHAPR supports the enactment of ADR Building-Intervention-Evaluation cycles by making explicit the roles, artefacts, reflective practices, and lightweight governance mechanisms required to sustain human accountability and learning in AI-assisted development. The contribution of the paper is conceptual: SHAPR itself is treated as the primary design artefact and unit of analysis and is evaluated formatively through reflective analysis of its internal coherence, alignment with ADR principles, and applicability to solo research practice. By explicitly linking research software development, Human-AI collaboration, and reflective learning, this study contributes to broader discussions on how SHAPR can support both knowledge production and HDR researcher training."}

Existing automated approaches, including traditional machine learning techniques and recent large language model (LLM)-based methods, often suffer from poor precision-recall trade-offs. Frequently evaluated on randomly sampled commits, we uncover that they are substantially underestimating real-world difficulty, where candidate commits are already security-relevant and highly similar. We propose Favia, a forensic, agent-based framework for vulnerability-fix identification that combines scalable candidate ranking with deep and iterative semantic reasoning. Favia first employs an efficient ranking stage to narrow the search space of commits. Each commit is then rigorously evaluated using a ReAct-based LLM agent. By providing the agent with a pre-commit repository as environment, along with specialized tools, the agent tries to localize vulnerable components, navigates the codebase, and establishes causal alignment between code changes and vulnerability root causes. This evidence-driven process enables robust identification of indirect, multi-file, and non-trivial fixes that elude single-pass or similarity-based methods. We evaluate Favia on CVEVC, a large-scale dataset we made that comprises over 8 million commits from 3,708 real-world repositories, and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art traditional and LLM-based baselines under realistic candidate selection, achieving the strongest precision-recall trade-offs and highest F1-scores."}

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the oldest core network protocols and remains the de facto mechanism for clock synchronization across the Internet today.

We %develop measurements to gather the first direct, non-inferential, and comprehensive data on the NTP pool, including: longitudinal server and account membership, server configurations, time quality, aliases, and global query traffic load.\n  We gather complete and granular data over a nine month period to discover over 15k servers (both active and inactive) and shed new light into the NTP Pool's use, dynamics, and robustness. By analyzing address aliases, accounts, and network connectivity, we find that only 19.7% of the pool's active servers are fully independent. Finally, we show that an adversary informed with our data can better and more precisely mount \"monopoly attacks\" to capture the preponderance of NTP pool traffic in 90% of all countries with only 10 or fewer malicious NTP servers. Our results suggest multiple avenues by which the robustness of the pool can be improved."}

Although the BMC is widely adopted by both practitioners and scholars, significant challenges remain in formally modelling business models, particularly with regard to explicit specification of inter-component relationships, while preserving the simplicity that characterises the BMC. Addressing this tension between modelling rigour and practical relevance, this research adopts a Design Science Research approach to formally specify relationships among BMC components and to strengthen their theoretical grounding through an adaptation of the V 4 framework. The proposed metamodel consolidates BMC relationships into three core types: supports, determines, and affects, providing explicit semantics while remaining accessible to end users through graphical tooling. The findings highlight that formally specifying relationships significantly improves the interpretability and consistency of BMC representations. The proposed metamodel and tool offer a rigorous yet usable foundation for developing DSML-based BMC tools and for enabling systematic integration of the BMC into widely used software and enterprise modelling environments, thereby bridging business modelling and enterprise architecture practices for both academics and practitioners."}

This dataset comprised the 1,000 most frequently accessed Internet resources, determined by the number of connection requests on CONUS DoDIN-A during the study period. We then compared all domains and subdomains in the dataset against Ghostery's WhoTracks.me, an open-source database of commercial tracking entities. We found that over 21% of the domains accessed during the study period were Internet trackers. The ACI recommends that the Army implement changes to its enterprise networks to limit commercial Internet-based tracking, as well as policy changes towards the same end. With relatively minor configuration changes, CBII can serve as a more effective mitigation against risks posed by commercially available information."}

While stationary strategies are preferred for their practicality, computing stationary forms of classic game-theoretic equilibria is computationally intractable -- a stark contrast to the comparative ease of solving single-agent RL or zero-sum games. To bridge this gap, we study Risk-averse Quantal response Equilibria (RQE), a solution concept rooted in behavioral game theory that incorporates risk aversion and bounded rationality. We demonstrate that RQE possesses strong regularity conditions that make it uniquely amenable to learning in MGs. We propose a novel two-timescale Actor-Critic algorithm characterized by a fast-timescale actor and a slow-timescale critic. Leveraging the regularity of RQE, we prove that this approach achieves global convergence with finite-sample guarantees. We empirically validate our algorithm in several environments to demonstrate superior convergence properties compared to risk-neutral baselines."}

Specifically, the quantization module, called Brevitas, is applied to implement fixed-point data processing, which allows for arbitrary specification of the bit widths for the integer and fractional parts. Two methods of fixed-point data quantization, quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ), are utilized in Brevitas. With Tensil, which is used in the current design flow, the bit widths of the integer and fractional parts need to be 8 bits each or 16 bits each when implemented in hardware, but performance validation has shown that accuracy comparable to floating-point operations can be maintained even with 6 bits or 5 bits each, indicating potential for further reduction in computational resources. These results clearly contribute to the creation of a versatile design and evaluation environment for edge AI hardware for few-shot learning."}

Manually tuning these parameters for optimal performance demands considerable expertise, while traditional auto-tuning approaches struggle with the enormous search space and low sample efficiency inherent to this domain. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and logical reasoning, offering new possibilities for system optimization. However, applying LLMs to real-time compaction tuning in such latency-sensitive environments is a double-edged sword. While large-scale LLMs can offer superior reasoning for strategy generation, their high inference latency and computational cost make them impractical for interactive, low-latency tuning. In contrast, small-scale LLMs achieve low latency but often at the expense of reasoning accuracy and tuning effectiveness. In this paper, we first evaluate this trade-off by analyzing the compaction-tuning performance and inference latency of LLMs at different scales in an LSM-tree-based tuning case. We then characterize the performance of LSM-tree on RocksDB v8.8.1, with a focus on adjusting the key compaction-related parameters under db_bench workloads.

While functionality-oriented GUI testing has attracted growing research attention, existing approaches largely overlook interactions across functionalities, making them ineffective at uncovering deep bugs hidden in inter-functional behaviors.

Based on the FFG, we further introduce an inter-functional-flow-oriented GUI testing approach with the dual goals of precise model construction and deep bug detection. This approach is realized through a long-short-term-view-guided testing process. By combining two complementary test-generation views, it can adaptively refine functional boundaries and systematically explore inter-functional flows under diverse triggering conditions. We implement our approach in a tool called FuncDroid, and evaluate it on two benchmarks: (1) a widely-used open-source benchmark with 50 reproducible crash bugs and (2) a diverse set of 52 popular commercial apps. Experimental results demonstrate that FuncDroid significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both coverage (+28%) and bug detection number (+107%). Moreover, FuncDroid successfully uncovers 18 previously unknown non-crash functional bugs in commercial apps, confirming its practical effectiveness."}

It is important to develop a network control system (NCS) that can continuously coordinate and optimize the movement of UxVs based on mission objectives.

In this paper, we present an approach to systematically increase the topology flexibility for an NCS by leveraging the well-studied concept of disruption-tolerant networking (DTN). We design a DTN-compatible communication utility model that, while allowing some nodes to temporarily disconnect from others, provides for a fine-grain specification of the minimum communication frequency and the maximum hops permitted for message delivery between each pair of nodes. As such, the model supports what-if analyses before a mission to determine the best communication parameters to use for a given set of UxVs. Furthermore, we incorporate our communication model into an existing NCS and evaluate its performance in a simulated scenario involving the use of five UxVs searching for an enemy ship. The results show that our model not only enables the NCS to find the enemy ship faster but also facilitates new capabilities, such as dividing the UxVs into multiple teams responsible for different search areas."}

This survey provides a comprehensive treatment of the agent skills landscape, as it has rapidly evolved during the last few months. We organize the field along four axes: (i) architectural foundations, examining the SKILL.md specification, progressive context loading, and the complementary roles of skills and MCP; (ii) skill acquisition, covering reinforcement learning with skill libraries (SAGE), autonomous skill discovery (SEAgent), and compositional skill synthesis; (iii) deployment at scale, including the computer-use agent (CUA) stack, GUI grounding advances, and benchmark progress on OSWorld and SWE-bench; and (iv) security, where recent empirical analyses reveal that 26.1\\% of community-contributed skills contain vulnerabilities, motivating our proposed Skill Trust and Lifecycle Governance Framework -- a four-tier, gate-based permission model that maps skill provenance to graduated deployment capabilities.

The key challenge is that optical switches support one-to-one connectivity at a time, limiting the fan-out of traffic in ML workloads using hybrid parallelisms. We overcome this through \\emph{parallelism-driven rail reconfiguration}, which exploits the non-overlapping communication phases of different parallelism dimensions. This time-multiplexes a single set of physical ports across circuit configurations tailored to each phase within a training iteration. We design and implement Opus, a control plane that orchestrates this in-job reconfiguration of photonic rails at parallelism phase boundaries, and evaluate it on a physical OCS testbed, the Perlmutter supercomputer, and in simulation at up to 2,048 GPUs.

Prior work in zero-shot coordination often follows a two-stage process, first generating a diverse training pool of partner agents, and then training a best-response agent to collaborate effectively with the entire training pool. While many previous works have achieved strong performance by devising better ways to diversify the partner agent pool, there has been less emphasis on how to leverage this pool to build an adaptive agent. One limitation is that the best-response agent may converge to a static, generalist policy that performs reasonably well across diverse teammates, rather than learning a more adaptive, specialist policy that can better adapt to teammates and achieve higher synergy. To address this, we propose an adaptive ensemble agent that uses Theory-of-Mind-based best-response selection to first infer its teammate's intentions and then select the most suitable policy from a policy ensemble. We conduct experiments in the Overcooked environment to evaluate zero-shot coordination performance under both fully and partially observable settings. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our method over a single best-response baseline."}

Our architecture's foundation is the use of ultra-dense Charge-Trap Transistors (CTTs) in Microscaling MXFP4 CIM arrays, uniquely enabling the on-chip storage of up to hundreds of millions of parameters in Fully Weight Stationary (FWS) fashion.\n  We introduce a statically partitioned design with 12 Transformer blocks connected by a deeply pipelined dataflow. Static-weight layers (MLPs and linear projections) execute on highly parallel analog CTT arrays using an MXFP4-native flow with per-block exponent alignment and a 10-bit SAR ADC.

These systems rely heavily on distributed architectures, requiring robust mechanisms to manage data and interactions among participants securely. One critical aspect of decentralized systems is key management, which is essential for encrypting files, securing database segments, and enabling private transactions. However, securely managing cryptographic keys in a distributed environment poses significant risks, especially when nodes in the network can be compromised [9]. This research proposes a decentralized database scheme specifically designed for secure and private key management. Our approach ensures that cryptographic keys are not stored explicitly at any location, preventing their discovery even if an attacker gains control of multiple nodes. Instead of traditional storage, keys are encoded and distributed using the BFLUT (Bloom Filter for Private Look-Up Tables) algorithm [7], which enables secure retrieval without direct exposure. The system leverages OrbitDB [4], IPFS [1], and IPNS [10] for decentralized data management, providing robust support for consistency, scalability, and simultaneous updates. By combining these technologies, our scheme enhances both security and privacy while maintaining high performance and reliability. Our findings demonstrate the system's capability to securely manage keys, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure privacy, making it a foundational solution for Web3 applications requiring decentralized security."}

Although code smells are widely believed to harm maintainability, most prior stability studies examine only the smells within the class being modified. In practice, however, classes can change because their efferent neighbors (i.e., the classes they depend on) are modified due to ripple effects that propagate along static dependencies, even if the class itself is clean. Such ripple effects may be more severe when the efferent neighbor exhibits code smells. In addition, code smells rarely occur alone. They often appear together within a class or across classes connected by static dependencies, a phenomenon known as code smell interrelation. Such interrelation can lead to code smell interaction, where smells are directly connected through static dependencies and may further compound maintainability issues. However, the effect of code smell interrelation and interaction on code quality remains largely underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates whether the presence of code smells in a class's efferent neighbors affects its stability, considering the factor of code smell interrelation and interaction. To achieve this, we mine one year of commit history from 100 top-starred GitHub projects, detect code smells and static dependencies, determine code smell interrelation and interaction, and model these factors as predictors of class stability."}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative method called Adaptive Meta-Aggregation Federated Learning (AMAFed), designed to enhance intrusion detection in heterogeneous IoT networks. By employing a dynamic weighting mechanism using meta-learning, AMAFed assigns adaptive importance to local models based on their data quality and contributions, enabling personalized yet collaborative learning across devices. The proposed method was evaluated on three benchmark IoT datasets: ToN-IoT, N-BaIoT, and BoT-IoT, representing diverse real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that AMAFed achieves detection accuracy up to 99.8% on ToN-IoT, with F1-scores exceeding 98% across all datasets.

Because a unit that is strong in isolation may not remain strong when combined, we sample across multiple small-team candidates. Our framework iterates between evaluating large-team outcomes and refining the pool of modular components, allowing convergence on increasingly effective strategies. Experiments demonstrate that this partitioning approach scales to substantially larger scenarios while preserving effectiveness and revealing cooperative behaviours that direct optimisation cannot reliably discover."}

While prior work has explored software optimizations and FPGA-based offload engines, these approaches remain physically distant from the CPU's memory hierarchy, incurring unnecessary data movement and cache pollution.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but IoT heterogeneity and limited computational resources cause increased latency and reduced performance. This paper introduces a novel approach Cluster-based federated intrusion detection with lightweight networks for heterogeneous IoT designed to address these limitations. The proposed framework utilizes a hierarchical IoT architecture that encompasses edge, fog, and cloud layers. Intrusion detection clients operate at the fog layer, leveraging federated learning to enhance data privacy and distributed processing efficiency. To enhance efficiency, the method employs the lightweight MobileNet model alongside a hybrid loss function that integrates Gumbel-SoftMax and SoftMax, optimizing resource consumption while maintaining high detection accuracy. A key feature of this approach is clustering IoT devices based on hardware similarities, enabling more efficient model training and aggregation tailored to each cluster's computational capacity. This strategy not only simplifies the complexity of managing heterogeneous data and devices but also improves scalability and overall system performance. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted using the ToN-IoT and CICDDoS2019 datasets.

This paper presents a Calibrated Federated Learning method with Hardware-aware Fuzzy Clustering (CF-HFC) to enhance intrusion detection performance in heterogeneous IoT networks. The proposed three-tier Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture integrates three complementary components: (1) hardware-aware fuzzy clustering, which organizes clients by computational capacity to mitigate straggler effects; (2) Fuzzy-FedProx aggregation, which stabilizes optimization under non-IID data distributions; and (3) Adaptive Conformal Calibration (ACC), which dynamically adjusts decision thresholds to balance false negative and false positive rates.

To address these challenges, we propose TriGen, a novel NPU architecture tailored for resource-constrained environments through software-hardware co-design. Firstly, TriGen adopts low-precision computation using microscaling (MX) to enable additional optimization opportunities while preserving accuracy, and resolves the issues that arise by employing such precision. Secondly, to jointly optimize both nonlinear and linear operations, TriGen eliminates the need for specialized hardware for essential nonlinear operations by using fast and accurate LUT, thereby maximizing performance gains and reducing hardware-cost in on-device environments, and finally, by taking practical hardware constraints into account, further employs scheduling techniques to maximize computational utilization even under limited on-chip memory capacity. We evaluate the performance of TriGen on various LLMs and show that TriGen achieves an average 2.73x performance speedup and 52% less memory transfer over the baseline NPU design with negligible accuracy loss."}

However, since QUIC provides end-to-end encryption for both data and packet headers, in-network assistance like Performance-Enhancing Proxy (PEP) is unavailable for QUIC. To achieve the similar optimization as TCP, some works seek to collaborate endpoints and middleboxes to provide in-network assistance for QUIC. But involving both host and in-network devices increases the difficulty of deployment in the Internet.\n  In this paper, by analyzing the QUIC standard, implementations, and the locality of application traffic, we identify opportunities for transparent middleboxes to measure RTT and infer packet loss for QUIC connections, despite the absence of plaintext ACK information. We then propose PEMI as a concrete system that continuously measures RTT and infers lost packets, enabling fast retransmissions for QUIC. PEMI enables performance enhancement for QUIC in a completely transparent manner, without requiring any explicit cooperation from the endpoints. To keep fairness, PEMI employs a delay-based congestion control and utilizes feedback-based methods to enforce CWND. Extensive evaluation results, including Mininet and trace-driven dynamic experiments, show that PEMI can significantly improve the performance of QUIC. For example, in the Mininet experiments, PEMI increases the goodput of file transfers by up to 2.5$\\times$, and reduces the 90th percentile jitter of RTC frames by 20-75%."}
