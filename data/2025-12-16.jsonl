However, this comes at the cost of increased memory access latency due to the need to rely on the network fabric to transfer data between remote nodes. As such, it is crucial to ascertain an application's memory latency sensitivity to minimize the overall performance impact. Existing tools for measuring memory latency sensitivity often rely on custom ad-hoc hardware or cycle-accurate simulators, which can be inflexible and time-consuming. To address this, we present EDAN (Execution DAG Analyzer), a novel performance analysis tool that leverages an application's runtime instruction trace to generate its corresponding execution DAG. This approach allows us to estimate the latency sensitivity of sequential programs and investigate the impact of different hardware configurations. EDAN not only provides us with the capability of calculating the theoretical bounds for performance metrics, but it also helps us gain insight into the memory-level parallelism inherent to HPC applications. We apply EDAN to applications and benchmarks such as PolyBench, HPCG, and LULESH to unveil the characteristics of their intrinsic memory-level parallelism and latency sensitivity."}

We revisit a trace-discovered connectivity model that derives a service dependency graph from traces and uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate endpoint availability under fail-stop service failures. Compared to earlier work, we (i) derive the graph directly from raw OpenTelemetry traces, (ii) attach endpoint-specific success predicates, and (iii) add a simple asynchronous semantics that treats Kafka edges as non-blocking for immediate HTTP success. We apply this model to the OpenTelemetry Demo (\"Astronomy Shop\") using a GitHub Actions workflow that discovers the graph, runs simulations, and executes chaos experiments that randomly kill microservices in a Docker Compose deployment. Across the studied failure fractions, the model reproduces the overall availability degradation curve, while asynchronous semantics for Kafka edges change predicted availabilities by at most about 10^(-5) (0.001 percentage points). This null result suggests that for immediate HTTP availability in this case study, explicitly modeling asynchronous dependencies is not warranted, and a simpler connectivity-only model is sufficient."}

However, precisely measuring the energy consumption of LLMs is often infeasible because hardware-based power monitors are not always accessible and software-based energy measurement tools are not accurate. While various prediction techniques have been developed to estimate LLM energy consumption, these approaches are limited to single-GPU environments and thus are not applicable to modern LLM inference which is typically parallelized across multiple GPUs. In this work, we remedy this gap and introduce PIE-P, a fine-grained energy prediction framework for multi-GPU inference, including tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism. Predicting the energy under parallelized inference is complicated by the non-determinism in inter-GPU communication, additional communication overheads, and difficulties in isolating energy during the communication/synchronization phase. We develop a scalable prediction framework that addresses these issues via precise sampling, fine-grained modeling of inter-GPU communication, and careful accounting of parallelization overhead. Our evaluation results show that PIE-P yields accurate and fine-grained energy predictions across parallelism strategies, significantly outperforming baselines."}

Progress is further limited by the absence of standardised metrics and fidelity tolerances, preventing principled hardware-software co-design and rigorous exploration of quality-efficiency trade-offs. We introduce astroCAMP, a framework for guiding the co-design of next-generation imaging pipelines and sustainable HPC architectures that maximise scientific return within SKA's operational and environmental limits. astroCAMP provides: (1) a unified, extensible metric suite covering scientific fidelity, computational performance, sustainability, and lifecycle economics; (2) standardised SKA-representative datasets and reference outputs enabling reproducible benchmarking across CPUs, GPUs, and emerging accelerators; and (3) a multi-objective co-design formulation linking scientific-quality constraints to time-, energy-, carbon-to-solution, and total cost of ownership. We release datasets, benchmarking results, and a reproducibility kit, and evaluate co-design metrics for WSClean and IDG on an AMD EPYC 9334 processor and an NVIDIA H100 GPU.

Based on our experience from several internally developed MVPs and a review of recent industry reports, this article analyzes the flow-debt tradeoffs associated with VC. The flow-debt trade-off arises when the seamless code generation occurs, leading to the accumulation of technical debt through architectural inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and increased maintenance overhead. These issues originate from process-level weaknesses, biases in model training data, a lack of explicit design rationale, and a tendency to prioritize quick code generation over human-driven iterative development.

We introduce a novel workflow design using large language model (LLM)-based agents in repeated decision-making scenarios, systematically manipulating price trajectories (fixed, ascending, descending, random) and network-effect strength. Our key findings include: First, without historical data, agents fail to infer equilibrium. Second, ordered historical sequences (e.g., escalating prices) enable partial convergence under weak network effects but strong effects trigger persistent \"AI optimism\"--agents overestimate participation despite contradictory evidence. Third, randomized history disrupts convergence entirely, demonstrating that temporal coherence in data shapes LLMs' reasoning, unlike humans. These results highlight a paradigm shift: in AI-mediated systems, equilibrium outcomes depend not just on incentives, but on how history is curated, which is impossible for human."}

The feature extractor exploits the weight clustering mechanism to reduce computational complexity, while the HDC-based FSL classifier eliminates gradient-based back propagation operations, enabling single-pass training with substantially reduced latency.

However, optimizing the access policies of Internet of Things devices to maximize the data freshness, measured as a function of the Age-of-Information (AoI) metric, is a challenging task. This work introduces two algorithms to optimize the information update process in cyber-physical systems operating under the generate-at-will model, by finding an online policy without knowing the characteristics of the transmission delay or the age cost function. The optimization seeks to minimize the time-average cost, which integrates the AoI at the receiver and the data transmission cost, making the approach suitable for a broad range of scenarios. Both algorithms employ policy gradient methods within the framework of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) and are specifically designed to handle continuous state and action spaces. Each algorithm minimizes the cost using a distinct strategy for deciding when to send an information update. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is feasible to apply the two strategies simultaneously, leading to an additional reduction in cost. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms exhibit good convergence properties and achieve a time-average cost within 3% of the optimal value, when the latter is computable. A comparison with other state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed algorithms outperform them in one or more of the following aspects: being applicable to a broader range of scenarios, achieving a lower time-average cost, and requiring a computational cost at least one order of magnitude lower."}

LiveUpdate addresses two core challenges: (1) dynamic rank adaptation via singular value monitoring to constrain memory overhead (<2% of EMTs), and (2) NUMA-aware resource scheduling with hardware-enforced QoS to eliminate update inference contention (P99 latency impact <20ms). Evaluations show LiveUpdate reduces update costs by 2x versus delta-update baselines while achieving higher accuracy within 1-hour windows.

These multi-agent architectures enable coordinated reasoning, planning, and execution across diverse domains, allowing agents to collaboratively automate complex workflows. Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment. We propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars encompassing LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment.

Die stacking creates the opportunity for a large DRAM design space through 3D integration and expanded total die area. To open and navigate this expansive design space of customized memory architectures that cater to application-specific needs, we introduce DreamRAM, a configurable bandwidth, capacity, energy, latency, and area modeling tool for custom 3D die-stacked DRAM designs. DreamRAM exposes fine-grained design customization parameters at the MAT, subarray, bank, and inter-bank levels, including extensions of partial page and subarray parallelism proposals found in the literature, to open a large previously-unexplored design space. DreamRAM analytically models wire pitch, width, length, capacitance, and scaling parameters to capture the performance tradeoffs of physical layout and routing design choices. Routing awareness enables DreamRAM to model a custom MAT-level routing scheme, Dataline-Over-MAT (DLOMAT), to facilitate better bandwidth tradeoffs. DreamRAM is calibrated and validated against published industry HBM3 and HBM2E designs. Within DreamRAM's rich design space, we identify designs that achieve each of 66% higher bandwidth, 100% higher capacity, and 45% lower power and energy per bit compared to the baseline design, each on an iso-bandwidth, iso-capacity, and iso-power basis."}

Significant improvements have been achieved in accelerating content transport and in compressing static content. Less attention, however, has been dedicated to dynamic content compression. Such content is commonly provided by JSON and DNS over HTTPS. Aligned with the overall Web trend, dynamic content objects continue to grow in size, which increases latency and fosters the digital inequality. In this paper, we propose to counter this increase by utilizing components engineered for the constrained Internet of Things (IoT). We focus on the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and its use for dynamic content encoded in JSON or in DNS over HTTPS messages. CBOR was originally introduced to restrict packet sizes in constrained environments and enables small, effective encoding of data objects. We measure that simply switching the data representation from JSON to CBOR reduces data by up to 80.0% for a corpus of JSON objects collected via the HTTP Archive. This size reduction can decrease loading times by up to 13.8% when downloading large objects -- even in local setups. A new CBOR-based DNS message format designed for use with DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over CoAP (DoC) minimizes packets by up to 95.5% in its packed form and shows large potential for additionally compressing names and addresses. We contribute two name compression schemes that apply to the new CBOR format and save up to 226 bytes in a response. The decoder for our name compression scheme is lean and can fit into as little as 314 bytes of binary build size. One of those compression schemes and further optimization proposals directly influenced further improvements of the new CBOR format within Internet standardization."}

We address this through a formal framework that reframes slice monitoring as a closed-loop control problem, and defines the minimal data plane requirements for SLA-aware slice monitoring via a telemetry primitive contract. We then present SliceScope, a realization of this framework that combines: (1) a control strategy that dynamically allocates the monitoring resources across diverse slices according to their SLA criticality, and (2) a data-plane based on change-triggered INT that provides per-packet end-to-end visibility with tunable accuracy-overhead trade-offs, satisfying the telemetry contract. Our evaluation results on programmable switches and in large-scale simulations with a mixture of different slice types, demonstrate that SliceScope tracks critical slices up to 4x more accurately compared to static baselines, while showing that change-triggered INT outperforms alternative primitives for realizing the telemetry primitive contract."}

To address these challenges in the complex environment of roundabout intersections, this paper proposes a roundabout control algorithm, which takes into account the uncertainty of interactive information caused by time delays. First, to maintain the required distance between the current vehicle and its preceding and following vehicles, conflicting vehicles are identified based on the time-to-collision (TTC) in the conflict zone. To fully consider communication performance, a vehicle motion model incorporating time delays is established. According to the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) mechanism, the vehicle motion control that satisfies the roundabout constraints is determined. Second, by scheduling the sequence of vehicles entering the roundabout, a multiscale optimization objective is developed by integrating vehicle motion indicators and roundabout system indicators. Traffic density and travel time are embedded into the optimization problem to guide vehicles to enter the roundabout safely and stably. Through a variety of simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is verified by comparing its performance with that of multiple control algorithms under different autonomous vehicle penetration rates and heavy traffic load scenarios."}

We address this barrier by investigating whether open-weight large language models, adapted via instruction tuning, can generate high-quality BPMN process models directly from natural language descriptions in a cost-effective and privacy-preserving way. We introduce InstruBPM, a reproducible approach that prepares paired text-diagram data and instruction tunes an open source large language model with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and quantization for on-prem deployment. We evaluate the tuned model through complementary perspectives: (i) text/code similarity using BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR, (ii) structural fidelity using Relative Graph Edit Distance, (iii) guidelines conformance using external tool checks, and (iv) a small expert review. Using a curated subset of a multi-domain BPMN dataset, we compare the tuned model with untuned open-weight baselines and strong proprietary models under consistent prompting regimes. Our compact tuned model outperforms all baselines across sequence and structural metrics while requiring substantially fewer resources; guideline analysis and expert feedback further indicate that the generated diagrams largely follow BPMN best practices and are useful starting points that reduce modeling effort. Overall, instruction tuning improves structural accuracy and robustness compared to untuned baselines and reduces reliance on heavy prompt scaffolding.

The architecture consists of transceiver IQ skew estimation methods and a low-complexity MIMO equalizer structure. Before the IQ skew estimation, the chromatic dispersion(CD) is pre-compensated in the transmitter(TX) by chirp filtering. The receiver(RX) IQ skew is estimated by Gardner's phase detector, and the TX skew is estimated by finding the value that yields the lowest equalizer error. The low-complexity MIMO equalizer consists of a complex-valued MIMO(CV-MIMO) and a real-valued DD-LMS MIMO(RV-MIMO), which employ a butterfly and a non-butterfly structure, respectively. The CV-MIMO is used to perform polarization demultiplexing. The RV-MIMO equalizes each of the two polarisations and simultaneously compensates for the TX IQ imbalance. The architecture first compensates for the IQ skew at low-complexity, and the other imperfections are compensated by the low-complexity MIMO equalizer. Therefore, this architecture can equalize signals impaired by the transceiver IQ imbalance with low complexity. A 100 km transmission simulation and experiment with 36 Gbaud dual-polarization quadrature amplitude modulation(DP-QAM) signals and offline DSP showed that, with the RX IQ skew estimation, the number of real multiplications is reduced by more than 70% compared with conventional cases.

However, LLM hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect citations to source code, remains a critical barrier to reliable developer assistance. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving verifiable, citation grounded code comprehension through hybrid retrieval and lightweight structural reasoning. Our work is grounded in systematic evaluation across 30 Python repositories with 180 developer queries, comparing retrieval modalities, graph expansion strategies, and citation verification mechanisms. We find that challenges of citation accuracy arise from the interplay between sparse lexical matching, dense semantic similarity, and cross file architectural dependencies. Among these, cross file evidence discovery is the largest contributor to citation completeness, but it is largely overlooked because existing systems rely on pure textual similarity without leveraging code structure. We advocate for citation grounded generation as an architectural principle for code comprehension systems and demonstrate this need by achieving 92 percent citation accuracy with zero hallucinations. Specifically, we develop a hybrid retrieval system combining BM25 sparse matching, BGE dense embeddings, and Neo4j graph expansion via import relationships, which outperforms single mode baselines by 14 to 18 percentage points while discovering cross file evidence missed by pure text similarity in 62 percent of architectural queries."}

However, precisely measuring the energy consumption of LLMs is often infeasible because hardware-based power monitors are not always accessible and software-based energy measurement tools are not accurate. While various prediction techniques have been developed to estimate LLM energy consumption, these approaches are limited to single-GPU environments and thus are not applicable to modern LLM inference which is typically parallelized across multiple GPUs. In this work, we remedy this gap and introduce PIE-P, a fine-grained energy prediction framework for multi-GPU inference, including tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism. Predicting the energy under parallelized inference is complicated by the non-determinism in inter-GPU communication, additional communication overheads, and difficulties in isolating energy during the communication/synchronization phase. We develop a scalable prediction framework that addresses these issues via precise sampling, fine-grained modeling of inter-GPU communication, and careful accounting of parallelization overhead. Our evaluation results show that PIE-P yields accurate and fine-grained energy predictions across parallelism strategies, significantly outperforming baselines."}

We improve gem5, an open-source simulator with over 1600 forks, and gem5 Resources, a centralized repository of over 2000 pre-packaged artifacts, to address these issues. While gem5 Resources enables artifact sharing, researchers still face challenges. Creating custom disk images is complex and time-consuming, with no standardized process across ISAs, making it difficult to extend and share images. gem5 provides limited guest-host communication features through a set of predefined exit events that restrict researchers' ability to dynamically control and monitor simulations. Lastly, running simulations with multiple workloads requires researchers to write custom external scripts to coordinate multiple gem5 simulations which creates error-prone and hard-to-reproduce workflows. To overcome this, we introduce several features in gem5 and gem5 Resources. We standardize disk-image creation across x86, ARM, and RISC-V using Packer, and provide validated base images with pre-annotated benchmark suites (NPB, GAPBS). We provide 12 new disk images, 6 new kernels, and over 200 workloads across three ISAs. We refactor the exit event system to a class-based model and introduce hypercalls for enhanced guest-host communication that allows researchers to define custom behavior for their exit events. We also provide a utility to remotely monitor simulations and the gem5-bridge driver for user-space m5 operations.

These approaches face two key limitations: (1) their reliance on pre-existing GitHub repositories offers limited flexibility, and (2) their primary focus on issue resolution tasks restricts their applicability to the much wider variety of tasks a software engineer must handle. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SWE-Playground, a novel pipeline for generating environments and trajectories which supports the training of versatile coding agents. Unlike prior efforts, SWE-Playground synthetically generates projects and tasks from scratch with strong language models and agents, eliminating reliance on external data sources. This allows us to tackle a much wider variety of coding tasks, such as reproducing issues by generating unit tests and implementing libraries from scratch. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on three distinct benchmarks, and results indicate that SWE-Playground produces trajectories with dense training signal, enabling agents to reach comparable performance with significantly fewer trajectories than previous works."}

A critical yet often overlooked dimension in this context is the inherent priority difference among clients; for instance, business-critical functions demand higher performance guarantees, as fulfilling such requests yields significantly greater business value. However, existing LLM serving schedulers fail to jointly optimize for both SLO attainment and client-level priorities.\n  To bridge this gap, we first \\textit{formalize multi-priority request scheduling as a service gain maximization problem}, where satisfying latency requirements for requests of different priorities contributes varying levels of gain. We then propose PROSERVE, a unified two-tier scheduling framework designed to maximize overall service gain. At the engine level, SlideBatching dynamically adapts batch formation and request ordering under varying load conditions, employing a sliding boundary mechanism to balance deadline-first and density-first strategies. At the service level, GoRouting performs gain-oriented and capability-aware dispatching across distributed instances, proactively reserving capacity for future high-priority or long requests.

Recent research has applied software fuzzers to hardware verification, but these rely on semantically blind random mutations that may generate shallow, low-quality stimuli unable to explore complex behaviors.

In this paper, we present Lyra, a heterogeneous RISC-V verification framework that addresses both challenges by pairing hardware-accelerated verification with an ISA-aware generative model. Lyra executes the DUT and reference model concurrently on an FPGA SoC, enabling high-throughput differential checking and hardware-level coverage collection. Instead of creating verification stimuli randomly or through simple mutations, we train a domain-specialized generative model, LyraGen, with inherent semantic awareness to generate high-quality, semantically rich instruction sequences. Empirical results show Lyra achieves up to $1.27\\times$ higher coverage and accelerates end-to-end verification by up to $107\\times$ to $3343\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art software fuzzers, while consistently demonstrating lower convergence difficulty."}

Our research problem is to choose a subset of candidate servers and assign them to the user cells such that the above goals are sustainably achieved under the above uncertainties. We formulate this problem as a stochastic bilevel optimization, which is strongly NP-hard and unseen in the literature.

Leveraging the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a cluster-guided anonymization technique that preserves contextual and statistical relationships within JIT datasets. Our method groups commits into feature-based clusters and employs an LLM to generate context-aware parameter configurations for each commit cluster, defining alpha-beta ratios and churn mixture distributions used for anonymization. Our evaluation on six projects (Cassandra, Flink, Groovy, Ignite, OpenStack, and Qt) shows that our LLM-based approach achieves privacy level 2 (IPR >= 80 percent), improving privacy by 18 to 25 percent over four state-of-the-art graph-based anonymization baselines while maintaining comparable F1 scores. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can act as adaptive anonymization engines when provided with cluster-specific statistical information about similar data points, enabling context-sensitive and privacy-preserving software analytics without compromising predictive accuracy."}

Kernel fusion is a key technique to alleviate this problem, but the fusion strategies of existing compilers and frameworks are limited to using local scratchpad memory. When the intermediate results exceed the limited capacity (such as FFN), the fusion fails. Although modern GPUs (like the NVIDIA H100) now incorporate an inter-core connection mechanism known as Distributed Shared Memory(DSM)--providing a larger, high-bandwidth, and low-latency on-chip memory pool--this hardware potential has yet to be exploited by software frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present FlashFuser, the first compiler framework to utilize inter-core connection for kernel fusion on modern GPUs. FlashFuser extends established fusion techniques to the DSM domain through three core contributions. First, we propose a powerful DSM-based communication abstraction that formalizes complex cluster-based data exchange patterns, such as reduce, shuffle and multiply. Second, we introduce a dataflow analyzer that generalizes loop scheduling, resource mapping, and tile selection to the distributed memory hierarchy; it determines the optimal execution order and tile sizes by quantifying data movement across memory levels. Finally, FlashFuser integrates these components into a unified search engine that employs analytical cost modeling and DSM-aware pruning strategies to efficiently discover the optimal execution plan. Our evaluation on an NVIDIA H100 GPU shows that FlashFuser reduces memory access by 58% and delivers kernel speedups of 3.3x against highly-tuned libraries and 4.1x against state-of-the-art compilers, resulting in a 1.24x end-to-end speedup."}

We apply this model to the OpenTelemetry Demo (\"Astronomy Shop\") using a GitHub Actions workflow that discovers the graph, runs simulations, and executes chaos experiments that randomly kill microservices in a Docker Compose deployment. Across the studied failure fractions, the model reproduces the overall availability degradation curve, while asynchronous semantics for Kafka edges change predicted availabilities by at most about 10^(-5) (0.001 percentage points). This null result suggests that for immediate HTTP availability in this case study, explicitly modeling asynchronous dependencies is not warranted, and a simpler connectivity-only model is sufficient."}

As systems grow in complexity, there is a pressing need for more scalable and efficient testing methodologies. This systematic literature review examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping penetration testing, analyzing 58 peer-reviewed studies from major academic databases. Our findings reveal that while AI-assisted pentesting is still in its early stages, notable progress is underway, particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL), which was the focus of 77% of the reviewed works. Most research centers on the discovery and exploitation phases of pentesting, where AI shows the greatest promise in automating repetitive tasks, optimizing attack strategies, and improving vulnerability identification. Real-world applications remain limited but encouraging, including the European Space Agency's PenBox and various open-source tools. These demonstrate AI's potential to streamline attack path analysis, analyze complex network topology, and reduce manual workload. However, challenges persist: current models often lack flexibility and are underdeveloped for the reconnaissance and post-exploitation phases of pentesting. Applications involving Large Language Models (LLMs) remain relatively under-researched, pointing to a promising direction for future exploration.

Powering down unused nodes can mitigate this problem, but poorly timed transitions introduce long delays and reduce overall performance. To address this trade-off, we present SPARS, a reinforcement learning-enabled simulator for power management in HPC job scheduling. SPARS integrates job scheduling and node power state management within a discrete-event simulation framework. It supports traditional scheduling policies such as First Come First Served and EASY Backfilling, along with enhanced variants that employ reinforcement learning agents to dynamically decide when nodes should be powered on or off. Users can configure workloads and platforms in JSON format, specifying job arrivals, execution times, node power models, and transition delays. The simulator records comprehensive metrics-including energy usage, wasted power, job waiting times, and node utilization-and provides Gantt chart visualizations to analyze scheduling dynamics and power transitions. Unlike widely used Batsim-based frameworks that rely on heavy inter-process communication, SPARS provides lightweight event handling and consistent simulation results, making experiments easier to reproduce and extend. Its modular design allows new scheduling heuristics or learning algorithms to be integrated with minimal effort. By providing a flexible, reproducible, and extensible platform, SPARS enables researchers and practitioners to systematically evaluate power-aware scheduling strategies, explore the trade-offs between energy efficiency and performance, and accelerate the development of sustainable HPC operations."}

This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother.

To address these challenges, SIGMA is an open-source training stack designed to improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of large-scale distributed training on early-life AI hardware. The core of this initiative is the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP), the system optimized for clusters with early-life AI accelerators. Since its launch in March 2025, LTP has significantly enhanced training reliability and operational productivity. Over the past five months, it has achieved an impressive 94.45% effective cluster accelerator utilization, while also substantially reducing node recycling and job-recovery times. Building on the foundation of LTP, the LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) successfully trained SIGMA-MOE, a 200B MoE model, using 2,048 AI accelerators. This effort delivered remarkable stability and efficiency outcomes, achieving 21.08% MFU, state-of-the-art downstream accuracy, and encountering only one stability incident over a 75-day period.

In this paper, we propose Janus, a scalable MoE inference system that disaggregates attention and experts on separate GPU sub-clusters, enabling each module to be managed and scaled independently. Janus incorporates three key designs for efficient, disaggregated MoE inference. First, it proposes an adaptive two-phase communication scheme that exploits intra- and inter-node bandwidth hierarchies for low-latency data exchange. Second, motivated by the memory-bound nature of MoE modules, Janus introduces a lightweight scheduler and implements it as a GPU kernel to balance the number of activated experts across GPUs at minimal overhead, thereby reducing inference latency.

The mapping process is refined via homogenisation and internal consistency improvement phases, and is followed by a data analysis phase. Given its fundamental nature, Construction and Programming is the most covered knowledge area at Bachelor level. Other knowledge areas are equally covered at Bachelor and Master level (e.g., software engineering models), while more advanced ones are almost exclusively covered at Master level. We identify three clusters of tightly coupled knowledge areas: (i) requirements, architecture, and design, (ii) testing, verification, and security, and (iii) process-oriented and DevOps topics. Dutch universities generally cover all knowledge areas uniformly, with minor deviations reflecting institutional research strengths. Our results highlight correlations among key knowledge areas and their potential for enhancing integrated learning. We also identify underrepresented areas, such as software engineering economics, which educators may consider including in curricula. We invite researchers to use our research method in their own geographical region, in order to contrast software engineering education programs across the globe."}

[Aims] Our goal is to introduce and evaluate seven attributes identified in the SE literature as relevant for formulating research problems (practical problem, context, implications/impacts, practitioners, evidence, objective, and research questions) in terms of their perceived importance and completeness, and learn how they can be applied. [Method] We conducted a workshop with 42 senior SE researchers during the ISERN 2024 meeting. The seven attributes were presented using a Problem Vision board filled with a research example. Participants discussed attributes in groups, shared written feedback, and individually completed a survey assessing their importance, completeness, and suggestions for improvement. [Results] The findings confirm the importance of the seven attributes in the formulation of industry-oriented research problems. Qualitative feedback illustrated how they can be applied in practice and revealed suggestions to refine them, such as incorporating financial criteria (e.g., ROI) into implications/impacts and addressing feasibility and constraints under evidence. [Conclusion] The results reaffirm the importance of the seven attributes in supporting a reflective and context-aware problem formulation. Adapting their use to specific research contexts can help to improve the alignment between academic research and industry needs."}

We revisit a trace-discovered connectivity model that derives a service dependency graph from traces and uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate endpoint availability under fail-stop service failures. Compared to earlier work, we (i) derive the graph directly from raw OpenTelemetry traces, (ii) attach endpoint-specific success predicates, and (iii) add a simple asynchronous semantics that treats Kafka edges as non-blocking for immediate HTTP success. We apply this model to the OpenTelemetry Demo (\"Astronomy Shop\") using a GitHub Actions workflow that discovers the graph, runs simulations, and executes chaos experiments that randomly kill microservices in a Docker Compose deployment. Across the studied failure fractions, the model reproduces the overall availability degradation curve, while asynchronous semantics for Kafka edges change predicted availabilities by at most about 10^(-5) (0.001 percentage points). This null result suggests that for immediate HTTP availability in this case study, explicitly modeling asynchronous dependencies is not warranted, and a simpler connectivity-only model is sufficient."}

This vision paper explores the use of artificial intelligence agents to support SE researchers during the early stage of a research project, the formulation of the research problem. Based on the Lean Research Inception framework and using a published study on code maintainability in machine learning as a reference, we developed a descriptive evaluation of a scenario illustrating how AI agents, integrated into LRI, can support SE researchers by pre filling problem attributes, aligning stakeholder perspectives, refining research questions, simulating multiperspective assessments, and supporting decision making. The descriptive evaluation of the scenario suggests that AI agent support can enrich collaborative discussions and enhance critical reflection on the value, feasibility, and applicability of the research problem. Although the vision of integrating AI agents into LRI was perceived as promising to support the context aware and practice oriented formulation of research problems, empirical validation is needed to confirm and refine the integration of AI agents into problem formulation."}

They demand a moderate effort for specification (which can be done via program annotations) and verification (which can be done automatically via software model checking). In this sense, they have the potential to form an interesting sweet spot between generic properties (that demand virtually no specification effort, and that are typically addressed by static analysis) and application-specific properties as addressed by full-fledged formal methods. Thus, they may form a gateway to wider and more economic use of formal methods in industrial embedded software development."}

Whereas blockchain solutions have important positive effects on the business domain, they also introduce constraints and may cause delayed or unforeseen negative effects, undermining business strategies. The diversity of blockchain patterns and lack of standardized frameworks linking business goals to technical design decisions make pattern selection a complex task for system architects. To address this challenge, we propose Blockchain--Technology-Aware Enterprise Modeling (BC-TEAEM), a decision support framework that combines ontologies of blockchain patterns and domain-independent soft goals with a multi-criteria decision-making approach. The framework focuses on the interplay between a domain expert and a technical expert to ensure alignment and traceability. By iteratively capturing and refining preferences, BC-TEAEM supports systematic selection of blockchain patterns. We develop a prototype decision support tool implementing our method and validate it through a case study of a pharmaceutical company's supply chain traceability system, demonstrating the framework's applicability. %a supply chain traceability case study."}

We address this gap by introducing code-aligned use case benchmarks, constructed through manual validation of both user-goal and subfunction use cases across nine real-world software projects. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first systematic study of LLMs and propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol that assesses actor correctness, name accuracy, path fidelity, and behavioral coverage. The results show that while LLMs can partially reconstruct system functionality, their performance varies significantly across projects, with particularly noticeable shortcomings in domain-specific and multi-module systems. The models also exhibit high omission rates and struggle to maintain consistent abstraction when aggregating subfunctions into user-goal use cases, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of LLM-based use case reverse engineering."}

The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART. These results demonstrate that PSALM provides a theoretically grounded and practically effective selection strategy for MT."}

These characteristics make it especially challenging to monitor the execution of quantum circuits, complicating essential tasks such as debugging and runtime monitoring. This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors. Although monitoring coverage is limited by the need to preserve delicate quantum properties, such as entanglement, QMON effectively detects errors while introducing no or negligible disturbance to the original quantum states. QMON facilitates the development of more robust and reliable quantum software as the field continues to mature."}

Our motivating study reveals that inefficient UI representation creates a critical performance bottleneck. However, UI representation optimization, formulated as the task of automatically generating programs that transform UI representations, faces two unique challenges. First, the lack of Boolean oracles, which traditional program synthesis uses to decisively validate semantic correctness, poses a fundamental challenge to co-optimization of token efficiency and completeness. Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task. First, UIFormer restricts the program space using a domain-specific language (DSL) that captures UI-specific operations. Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance. Real-world industry deployment at WeChat further validates the practical impact of UIFormer."}

We propose the Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS), including an Annotation Negotiation Card to align stakeholders on objectives and constraints, and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification to express atomic and verifiable data annotation requirements. We evaluate DARS with an automotive perception case related to an ongoing project, and a mapping against 18 real-world data annotation error types. The results suggest that DARS mitigates root causes of completeness, accuracy, and consistency annotation errors.

The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency."}

Yet has this assumption been rigorously tested?\n  The counter-evidence presented in this paper suggests otherwise: across dozens of optimization problems from recent SE literature, including software configuration and performance tuning, cloud and systems optimization, project and process-level decision modeling, behavioral analytics, financial risk modeling, project health prediction, reinforcement learning tasks, sales forecasting, and software testing, even with just a few dozen labels, very simple methods (e.g. diversity sampling, a minimal Bayesian learner, or random probes) achieve near 90% of the best reported results. Further, these simple methods perform just as well as more state-of-the-the-art optimizers like SMAC, TPE, DEHB etc. While some tasks would require better outcomes and more sampling, these results seen after a few dozen samples would suffice for many engineering needs (particularly when the goal is rapid and cost-efficient guidance rather than slow and exhaustive optimization).\n  Our results highlight that some SE tasks may be better served by lightweight approaches that demand fewer labels and far less computation. We hence propose the data-light challenge: when will a handful of labels suffice for SE tasks? To enable a large-scale investigation of this issue, we contribute (1) a mathematical formalization of labeling, (2) lightweight baseline algorithms, and (3) results on public-domain data showing the conditions under which lightweight methods excel or fail.\n  For the purposes of open science, our scripts and data are online at https://github.com/KKGanguly/NEO ."}

These multi-agent architectures enable coordinated reasoning, planning, and execution across diverse domains, allowing agents to collaboratively automate complex workflows. Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment. We propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars encompassing LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment.

However, the traditional paradigm of developing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the system incurs significant overhead, especially as systems grow in complexity. This paper proposes a new paradigm, generative file systems, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and evolve a file system from prompts, effectively addressing the need for robust evolution. Despite the widespread success of LLMs in code generation, attempts to create a functional file system have thus far been unsuccessful, mainly due to the ambiguity of natural language prompts.\n  This paper introduces SYSSPEC, a framework for developing generative file systems. Its key insight is to replace ambiguous natural language with principles adapted from formal methods. Instead of imprecise prompts, SYSSPEC employs a multi-part specification that accurately describes a file system's functionality, modularity, and concurrency. The specification acts as an unambiguous blueprint, guiding LLMs to generate expected code flexibly. To manage evolution, we develop a DAG-structured patch that operates on the specification itself, enabling new features to be added without violating existing invariants. Moreover, the SYSSPEC toolchain features a set of LLM-based agents with mechanisms to mitigate hallucination during construction and evolution. We demonstrate our approach by generating SPECFS, a concurrent file system. SPECFS passes hundreds of regression tests, matching a manually-coded baseline. We further confirm its evolvability by seamlessly integrating 10 real-world features from Ext4. Our work shows that a specification-guided approach makes generating and evolving complex systems not only feasible but also highly effective."}
