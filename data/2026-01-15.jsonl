Single-thread GEMM implementations are well-optimised with techniques like blocking and autotuning. However, due to the complexity of modern multi-core shared memory systems, it is challenging to determine the number of threads that minimises the multi-thread GEMM runtime. We present a proof-of-concept approach to building an Architecture and Data-Structure Aware Linear Algebra (ADSALA) software library that uses machine learning to optimise the runtime performance of BLAS routines. More specifically, our method uses a machine learning model on-the-fly to automatically select the optimal number of threads for a given GEMM task based on the collected training data. Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB."}

One of the main challenges in parallel BFT is the view change process that happens when the leader node fails, which can lead to performance bottlenecks. Existing parallel BFT protocols typically rely on passive view change mechanisms with blind leader rotation. Such approaches frequently select unavailable or slow nodes as leaders, resulting in degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose a View Change Optimization (VCO) model based on mixed integer programming that optimizes leader selection and follower reassignment across parallel committees by considering communication delays and failure scenarios. We applied a decomposition method with efficient subproblems and improved benders cuts to solve the VCO model. Leveraging the results of improved decomposition solution method, we propose an efficient iterative backup leader selection algorithm as views proceed. By performing experiments in Microsoft Azure cloud environments, we demonstrate that the VCO-driven parallel BFT outperforms existing configuration methods under both normal operation and faulty condition. The results show that the VCO model is effective as network size increases, making it a suitable solution for high-performance parallel BFT systems."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce MACRO-LLM, LLM-empowered multi-agent collaborative reasoning under spatiotemporal partial observability. The architecture addresses spatiotemporal constraints via three modules: (1) the CoProposer mitigates temporal uncertainty by verifying candidate actions via predictive rollouts; (2) the Negotiator overcomes spatial myopia by resolving conflicts through mean-field statistical aggregation; and (3) the Introspector ensures continuous adaptation by analyzing historical experience to refine strategies via semantic gradient descent. Extensive evaluations on two complex long-horizon tasks, cooperative adaptive cruise control and pandemic control, demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates spatiotemporal partial observability through spatial and temporal strategies, enabling robust coordination."}

The SP model utilizes the software-defined networks (SDN) paradigm with less information gathered from the DCN data plane, besides the traditional hash-based flow scheduling mechanism, the Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP). In SDN, the proposed methodology harnesses a minimal yet powerful set of statistical data extracted from the DCN data plane, including port throughput and elephant flow information on the aggregate switches of the DCN fat-tree topology. Several experiments, in addition to theoretical analysis, have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SP model in terms of QoS enhancement.

Recent MAS routing methods aim to balance performance and overhead by dynamically selecting agent roles and language models. However, these approaches typically rely on a homogeneous collaboration mode, where all agents follow the same interaction pattern, limiting collaboration flexibility across different roles. Motivated by Social Capital Theory, which emphasizes that different roles benefit from distinct forms of collaboration, we propose SC-MAS, a framework for constructing heterogeneous and cost-efficient multi-agent systems. SC-MAS models MAS as directed graphs, where edges explicitly represent pairwise collaboration strategies, allowing different agent pairs to interact through tailored communication patterns. Given an input query, a unified controller progressively constructs an executable MAS by selecting task-relevant agent roles, assigning edge-level collaboration strategies, and allocating appropriate LLM backbones to individual agents. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SC-MAS. In particular, SC-MAS improves accuracy by 3.35% on MMLU while reducing inference cost by 15.38%, and achieves a 3.53% accuracy gain with a 12.13% cost reduction on MBPP. These results validate the feasibility of SC-MAS and highlight the effectiveness of heterogeneous collaboration in multi-agent systems."}

Such behavior is modeled by the Time-Varying Holding Cost (TVHC) problem, where each job's instantaneous holding cost increases with its current age (a job's age is the time since it arrived). The goal of the TVHC problem is to find a scheduling policy that minimizes the time-average total holding cost across all jobs.\n  However, no optimality results are known for the TVHC problem outside of the asymptotic regime. In this paper, we study a simple yet still challenging special case: A two-class M/M/1 queue in which class 1 jobs incur a non-decreasing, time-varying holding cost and class 2 jobs incur a constant holding cost.\n  Our main contribution is deriving the first optimal (non-decreasing) index policy for this special case of the TVHC problem. Our optimal policy, called LookAhead, stems from the following idea: Rather than considering each job's current holding cost when making scheduling decisions, we should look at their cost some $X$ time into the future, where this $X$ is intuitively called the ``lookahead amount.\" This paper derives that optimal lookahead amount."}

This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model.

This work investigates whether conventional DSS approaches inadvertently exacerbate the rural digital divide. Through large-scale, 3GPP-compliant non-terrestrial network (NTN) simulations with geographically distributed users, we systematically evaluate standard allocation policies. The results uncover a stark and persistent structural bias: SNR-priority scheduling induces a 1.65x urban-rural access disparity, privileging users with favorable satellite geometry. Counter-intuitively, increasing system bandwidth amplifies rather than alleviates this gap, with disparity rising from 1.0x to 1.65x as resources expand. To remedy this, we propose FairShare, a lightweight, quota-based framework that enforces geographic fairness. FairShare not only reverses the bias, achieving an affirmative disparity ratio of Delta_geo = 0.72x, but also reduces scheduler runtime by 3.3%. This demonstrates that algorithmic fairness can be achieved without trading off efficiency or complexity.

Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. We present a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without the prohibitive computational costs associated with model post-training. Leveraging the GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework, we iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop. This process utilizes crossover and mutation of instructions, guided by expert-curated gold examples and structured feedback based on clause- and clause parameter-level mismatches between the gold and predicted pragma. In our evaluation on the PolyBench suite, we observe an increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragma generated using the optimized prompts compared to those annotated using the simpler initial prompt, particularly for the \"nano\"-scale models. Specifically, with optimized prompts, the compilation success rate for GPT-4.1 Nano surged from 66.7% to 93.3%, and for GPT-5 Nano improved from 86.7% to 100%, matching or surpassing the capabilities of their significantly larger, more expensive versions. Beyond compilation, the optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs that achieve functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines. These results demonstrate that prompt optimization effectively unlocks the potential of smaller, cheaper LLMs in writing stable and effective GPU-offloading directives, establishing a cost-effective pathway to automated directive-based parallelization in HPC workflows."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. We present a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without the prohibitive computational costs associated with model post-training. Leveraging the GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework, we iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop. This process utilizes crossover and mutation of instructions, guided by expert-curated gold examples and structured feedback based on clause- and clause parameter-level mismatches between the gold and predicted pragma. In our evaluation on the PolyBench suite, we observe an increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragma generated using the optimized prompts compared to those annotated using the simpler initial prompt, particularly for the \"nano\"-scale models. Specifically, with optimized prompts, the compilation success rate for GPT-4.1 Nano surged from 66.7% to 93.3%, and for GPT-5 Nano improved from 86.7% to 100%, matching or surpassing the capabilities of their significantly larger, more expensive versions. Beyond compilation, the optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs that achieve functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines. These results demonstrate that prompt optimization effectively unlocks the potential of smaller, cheaper LLMs in writing stable and effective GPU-offloading directives, establishing a cost-effective pathway to automated directive-based parallelization in HPC workflows."}

Decades of work has helped harden C code against attackers, but C projects do not consist of only C code. C projects also contain build system code for automating development tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging. These build systems are critcal to software supply chain security and vulnerable to being poisoned, with the XZ Utils and SolarWinds attacks being recent examples. Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack. We outline our future plans to protect against pipeline poisoning by automatically checking development phase isolation. We envision a future where build system security checkers are as prevalent as program code checkers."}

They produce inconsistent results when executed multiple times on the same code, invalidating the assumption that a test failure indicates a software defect. Recent work on LLM-based test generation has identified flakiness as a potential problem with generated tests. However, its prevalence and underlying causes are unclear. We examined the flakiness of LLM-generated tests in the context of four relational database management systems: SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite. We amplified test suites with two LLMs, GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, to assess the flakiness of the generated test cases. Our results suggest that generated tests have a slightly higher proportion of flaky tests compared to existing tests. Based on a manual inspection, we found that the most common root cause of flakiness was the reliance of a test on a certain order that is not guaranteed (\"unordered collection\"), which was present in 72 of 115 flaky tests (63%). Furthermore, both LLMs transferred the flakiness from the existing tests to the newly generated tests via the provided prompt context. Our experiments suggest that flakiness transfer is more prevalent in closed-source systems such as SAP HANA than in open-source systems. Our study informs developers on what types of flakiness to expect from LLM-generated tests. It also highlights the importance of providing LLMs with tailored context when employing LLMs for test generation."}

SafePlanner targets two core challenges: generating structurally meaningful test scenarios and detecting hazardous planning behaviors. To maximize coverage, SafePlanner performs a structural analysis of the Plan model implementation - specifically, its scene-transition logic and hierarchical control flow - and uses this insight to extract feasible scene transitions from code. It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS. It generates 20635 test cases and detects 520 hazardous behaviors, grouped into 15 root causes through manual analysis. For four of these, we applied patches based on our analysis; the issues disappeared, and no apparent side effects were observed. SafePlanner achieves 83.63 percent function and 63.22 percent decision coverage on the Plan model, outperforming baselines in both bug discovery and efficiency."}

However, when these libraries introduce defects, ranging from silent computation errors to subtle performance regressions, it is often challenging for downstream users to assess whether their own programs are affected. Such impact analysis requires not only understanding the defect semantics but also checking whether the client code satisfies complex triggering conditions involving configuration flags, runtime environments, and indirect API usage. We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered. To improve accuracy and explainability, DepRadar integrates static analysis with DL-specific domain rules for defect reasoning and client side tracing. We evaluate DepRadar on 157 PRs and 70 commits across two representative DL libraries. It achieves 90% precision in defect identification and generates high quality structured fields (average field score 1.6). On 122 client programs, DepRadar identifies affected cases with 90% recall and 80% precision, substantially outperforming other baselines."}

Despite its broad adoption, little is known about the challenges users face during the development and maintenance of these pipelines. This paper presents an empirical study of 25,173 issues and pull requests from these pipelines to uncover recurring challenges, management practices, and perceived difficulties. Using BERTopic modeling, we identify 13 key challenges, including pipeline development and integration, bug fixing, integrating genomic data, managing CI configurations, and handling version updates. We then examine issue resolution dynamics, showing that 89.38\\% of issues and pull requests are eventually closed, with half resolved within three days. Statistical analysis reveals that the presence of labels (large effect, $δ$ = 0.94) and code snippets (medium effect, $δ$ = 0.50) significantly improve resolution likelihood. Further analysis reveals that tool development and repository maintenance poses the most significant challenges, followed by testing pipelines and CI configurations, and debugging containerized pipelines. Overall, this study provides actionable insights into the collaborative development and maintenance of nf-core pipelines, highlighting opportunities to enhance their usability, sustainability, and reproducibility."}

This process is challenging because such bugs are non-deterministic, and bug reports often lack the detailed information needed. Additionally, the unstructured nature of reports written in natural language makes it difficult to extract necessary details. Existing tools are inadequate to reproduce these bugs due to their inability to manage the specific interleaving at the system call level. To address these challenges, we propose SysPro, a novel approach that automatically extracts relevant system call names from bug reports and identifies their locations in the source code. It generates input data by utilizing information retrieval, regular expression matching, and the category-partition method. This extracted input and interleaving data are then used to reproduce bugs through dynamic source code instrumentation. Our empirical study on real-world benchmarks demonstrates that SysPro is both effective and efficient at localizing and reproducing system-level concurrency bugs from bug reports."}

However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries). We also observe that the granularity at which the plain LLM is applied has a significant impact on the cost. We therefore propose targeting first the program classes, where test generation is more efficient, and then the uncovered methods to reduce the number of LLM requests. This strategy achieves comparable (slightly higher) effectiveness while requiring about 20% fewer LLM requests."}

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation."}
