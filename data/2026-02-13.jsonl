High-throughput RL post-training therefore relies on dedicated RDMA HPC clusters, an infrastructure cost most organizations cannot absorb. A natural alternative is to aggregate loosely-coupled GPUs over standard Ethernet and WAN links, but this commodity connectivity cannot sustain full-weight broadcasts: synchronizing an 8B model can take over 100~seconds on bandwidth-limited links, while rollout generation typically takes tens of seconds.\n  Toward making RL practical in this regime, we observe that RL fine-tuning yields highly sparse per-step updates, with only around 1\\% of parameter elements changing. Atop this insight, we present SparrowRL, a novel high-performance RL training system that preserves bit-exact updates without dropping or quantizing information, designed for commodity-networked, loosely-coupled GPU resources. SparrowRL represents each step as a sparse delta checkpoint, pipelines delta extraction with multi-stream transmission, overlaps transfer with rollout generation, and coordinates heterogeneous workers with throughput- and bandwidth-aware scheduling plus lease-based fault tolerance. On Qwen3 models from 4B to 14B deployed across up to four geographic regions, SparrowRL reduces per-step transfer payload by 79$\\times$ for Qwen3-8B and improves throughput by 2.4--9.5$\\times$ over full-weight broadcast across WAN, narrowing the throughput gap relative to an ideal RDMA single-datacenter baseline to within 8.91\\%.

Adding calibrated random noise before communication to satisfy differential privacy offers a proven defense; however, most existing methods are tailored to specific downstream tasks and lack a general, protocol-level privacy-preserving solution. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentially Private Perturbed Push-Sum (DPPS), a lightweight differential privacy protocol for decentralized communication. Since protocol-level differential privacy introduces the unique challenge of obtaining the sensitivity for each communication round, DPPS introduces a novel sensitivity estimation mechanism that requires each node to compute and broadcast only one scalar per round, enabling rigorous differential privacy guarantees. This design allows DPPS to serve as a plug-and-play, low-cost privacy-preserving solution for downstream applications built on it. To provide a concrete instantiation of DPPS and better balance the privacy-utility trade-off, we design PartPSP, a privacy-preserving decentralized algorithm for non-convex optimization that integrates a partial communication mechanism. By partitioning model parameters into local and shared components and applying DPPS only to the shared parameters, PartPSP reduces the dimensionality of consensus data, thereby lowering the magnitude of injected noise and improving optimization performance. We theoretically prove that PartPSP converges under non-convex objectives and, with partial communication, achieves better optimization performance under the same privacy budget. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of DPPS's privacy-preserving and demonstrate that PartPSP outperforms existing privacy-preserving decentralized optimization algorithms."}

The core of LAER-MoE is a novel parallel paradigm, Fully Sharded Expert Parallel (FSEP), which fully partitions each expert parameter by the number of devices and restores partial experts at expert granularity through All-to-All communication during training. This allows for flexible re-layout of expert parameters during training to enhance load balancing. In particular, we perform fine-grained scheduling of communication operations to minimize communication overhead. Additionally, we develop a load balancing planner to formulate re-layout strategies of experts and routing schemes for tokens during training.

In this work, we introduce Counterfactual Conditional Likelihood (CCL) rewards, which score each agent's exploration by isolating its unique contribution to team exploration. Unlike prior methods that reward agents solely for the novelty of their individual observations, CCL emphasizes observations that are informative with respect to the joint exploration of the team. Experiments in continuous multiagent domains show that CCL rewards accelerate learning for domains with sparse team rewards, where most joint actions yield zero rewards, and are particularly effective in tasks that require tight coordination among agents."}

We introduce GORGO, a method for minimizing TTFT by optimizing a total serving cost as a function of available compute, network latency, and prefix caching. Using extensive profiling on custom infrastructure, we analyze component-level latency bottlenecks and benchmark GORGO against three baselines: (1) naive least-load routing, which ignores prefix-cache overlap; (2) prefix-similarity routing, which selectively pushes requests to the replica with the highest cached-prefix overlap; and (3) a centralized HTTP proxy that runs the GORGO policy while tracking requests across all nodes. We demonstrate that GORGO reduces P99 TTFT through network-aware routing and improves average TTFT by preventing pathological cross-region forwarding. Additionally, we find that GORGO-proxy overcomes synchronization overhead in previous methods and is 2.5x faster on median TTFT, demonstrating the success of a centralized router."}

For such systems to be deployed in society, agents must be able to establish cooperation and coordination under real-world computational and communication constraints. We propose the FLCOA framework (Five Layers for Cooperation/Coordination among Autonomous Agents) to conceptualize how cooperation and coordination emerge in groups of autonomous agents, and highlight that the influence of lower-layer factors - especially computational and communication resources - has been largely overlooked. To examine the effect of communication delay, we introduce a Continuous Prisoner's Dilemma with Communication Delay and conduct simulations with LLM-based agents. As delay increases, agents begin to exploit slower responses even without explicit instructions. Interestingly, excessive delay reduces cycles of exploitation, yielding a U-shaped relationship between delay magnitude and mutual cooperation. These results suggest that fostering cooperation requires attention not only to high-level institutional design but also to lower-layer factors such as communication delay and resource allocation, pointing to new directions for MAS research."}

Instead of relying on per-instance containers, SWE-MiniSandbox executes each task in an isolated workspace backed by kernel-level mechanisms, substantially reducing system overhead. It leverages lightweight environment pre-caching techniques to eliminate the need for bulky container images. As a result, our approach lowers disk usage to approximately 5\\% of that required by container-based pipelines and reduces environment preparation time to about 25\\% of the container baseline.

Security vulnerabilities arise from the decentralized architecture as well, particularly threats posed by Byzantine nodes. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel framework utilizing Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization for tokenizing network resources. RWA tokenization uses blockchain to convert ownership rights of real-world assets into digital tokens that can be programmed, divided, and traded. We then analyze the criteria for identifying suitable assets. Through a case study on dynamic spectrum allocation, we demonstrate the superior performance of this RWA approach.

However, managing resources and optimizing costs remain challenging for successfully executing tasks in cloud-based containerization for IoT. This paper proposes AUC-RAC, an auction-based mechanism for efficient offloading of computation tasks among multiple local servers in the context of IoT devices. The approach leverages the concept of Docker swarm, which connects multiple local servers in the form of Manager Node (MN) and Worker Nodes (WNs). It uses Docker containerization to execute tasks simultaneously. In this system, IoT devices send tasks to the MN, which then sends the task details to all its WNs to participate in the auction-based bidding process. The auctionbased bidding process optimizes the allocation of computation tasks among multiple systems, considering their resource sufficiency. The experimental analysis establishes that the approach offers improved offloading and computation-intensive services for IoT devices by enabling cooperation between local servers."}

Even with Processing-In-Memory (PIM) technology, current single-level memory designs cannot simultaneously satisfy the bandwidth and capacity requirements.\n  To address these challenges, we propose Processing Across Memory (PAM), a KV-centric LLM serving system that coordinates heterogeneous PIM-enabled memory devices within a hierarchical architecture.

First, PAM exploits the inherent context locality in KV access patterns to intelligently distribute KV tokens across the memory hierarchy. Second, to further exploit context locality, it introduces the PAMattention algorithm, enabling fine-grained parallel attention computation across heterogeneous PIM devices. Finally, PAM incorporates an intra-device KV mapping, inter-device KV migration interface, and an inter-device online KV scheduling algorithm to dynamically balance computational workloads. By addressing both bandwidth and capacity demands simultaneously, PAM significantly enhances the efficiency and scalability of LLM serving systems, paving the way for cost-effective, high-performance solutions in the era of large-scale AI."}

The problem has been studied since the early 1970s, under a variety of assumptions on feedback given to the parties, how the parties wake up, knowledge of $n$, and so on. The most consistent assumption is that parties do not have access to a global clock, only their local time since wake-up. This is surprising because the assumption of a global clock is both technologically realistic and algorithmically interesting. It enriches the problem, and opens the door to entirely new techniques. Our primary results are: [1] We design a new Contention Resolution protocol that guarantees latency $$O\\left(\\left(n\\log\\log n\\log^{(3)} n\\log^{(4)} n\\cdots \\log^{(\\log^* n)} n\\right)\\cdot 2^{\\log^* n}\\right) \\le n(\\log\\log n)^{1+o(1)}$$ in expectation and with high probability.

[2] Prior analyses of randomized ContentionResolution protocols in LocalClock guaranteed a certain latency with high probability, i.e., with probability $1-1/\\text{poly}(n)$.

The In-Expectation complexity is $Θ(n \\log n/\\log\\log n)$ whereas the With-High-Probability latency is $Θ(n\\log^2 n/\\log\\log n)$. Three of these four upper and lower bounds are new. [3] Given the complexity separation above, one would naturally want a ContentionResolution protocol that is optimal under both the In-Expectation and With-High-Probability metrics. This is impossible! It is even impossible to achieve In-Expectation latency $o(n\\log^2 n/(\\log\\log n)^2)$ and With-High-Probability latency $n\\log^{O(1)} n$ simultaneously."}

However, their effectiveness is often constrained by fidelity: simulators may deviate from the behavior of the final RTL, leading to unreliable performance estimates. Consequently, model calibration, which aligns simulator behavior with the RTL as the ground-truth microarchitecture, becomes essential for achieving accurate performance modeling.\n  To facilitate model calibration accuracy, we propose Microarchitecture Cliffs, a benchmark generation methodology designed to expose mismatches in microarchitectural behavior between the simulator and RTL. After identifying the key architectural components that require calibration, the Cliff methodology enables precise attribution of microarchitectural differences to a single microarchitectural feature through a set of benchmarks. In addition, we develop a set of automated tools to improve the efficiency of the Cliff workflow.\n  We apply the Cliff methodology to calibrate the XiangShan version of gem5 (XS-GEM5) against the XiangShan open-source CPU (XS-RTL). We reduce the performance error of XS-GEM5 from 59.2% to just 1.4% on the Cliff benchmarks. Meanwhile, the calibration guided by Cliffs effectively reduces the relative error of a representative tightly coupled microarchitectural feature by 48.03%. It also substantially lowers the absolute performance error, with reductions of 15.1% and 21.0% on SPECint2017 and SPECfp2017, respectively."}

DEpiABS captures individual-level heterogeneity in health status, behaviour, and resource constraints, while also modelling epidemic processes like viral mutation and reinfection dynamics. The model is fully differentiable, enabling fast simulation and gradient-based parameter calibration. Building on this foundation, we introduce a z-score-based scaling method that maps small-scale simulations to any real-world population sizes with negligible loss in output granularity, reducing the computational burden when modelling large populations. We validate DEpiABS through sensitivity analysis and calibration to COVID-19 and flu data from ten regions of varying scales. Compared to the baseline, DEpiABS is more detailed, fully interpretable, and has reduced the average normal deviation in forecasting from 0.97 to 0.92 on COVID-19 mortality data and from 0.41 to 0.32 on influenza-like-illness data. Critically, these improvements are achieved without relying on auxiliary data, making DEpiABS a reliable, generalisable, and data-efficient framework for future epidemic response modelling."}

Under review for KDD 2026", "summary": "We present Agent-Diff, a novel benchmarking framework for evaluating agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on real-world tasks that execute code via external APIs. Agentic LLM performance varies due to differences in models, external tool access, prompt structures, and agentic frameworks. Benchmarks must make fundamental trade-offs between a sandboxed approach that controls for variation in software environments and more ecologically valid approaches employing real services. Agent-Diff attempts to capture the desirable features of both of these approaches by including access to the real API interfaces for software services while sandboxing the environment in which calls are made, processed, and evaluated. This approach relies on two key innovations. The first is a novel state-diff contract, which separates process from outcome - rather than fuzzy trace or parameter matching, we define task success as whether the expected change in environment state was achieved. The second is a novel sandbox that provides a standardized scripting layer that all models use to execute code against external APIs (Slack, Box, Linear, Google Calendar). Thus, we can evaluate different agentic LLMs against a standardized set of contracts using a unified sandbox while still evaluating their performance on real-world service interfaces. Using the Agent-Diff framework, we provide benchmarks for nine LLMs across 224 tasks utilizing enterprise software workflows. In addition, we evaluate the robustness of the framework with ablation experiments to assess the contribution of access to API documentation on benchmark performance.

Such execution also plays a pivotal role in the parallel execution of numerous tasks in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Leveraging the computing resources of multiple devices, the offloading and processing of computationintensive tasks can be carried out more efficiently. However, managing resources and optimizing costs remain challenging for successfully executing tasks in cloud-based containerization for IoT. This paper proposes AUC-RAC, an auction-based mechanism for efficient offloading of computation tasks among multiple local servers in the context of IoT devices. The approach leverages the concept of Docker swarm, which connects multiple local servers in the form of Manager Node (MN) and Worker Nodes (WNs). It uses Docker containerization to execute tasks simultaneously. In this system, IoT devices send tasks to the MN, which then sends the task details to all its WNs to participate in the auction-based bidding process. The auctionbased bidding process optimizes the allocation of computation tasks among multiple systems, considering their resource sufficiency. The experimental analysis establishes that the approach offers improved offloading and computation-intensive services for IoT devices by enabling cooperation between local servers."}

With growing requests and context lengths, key-value (KV)-related operations, including attention computation and KV cache storage, have emerged as critical bottlenecks. They require massive memory bandwidth and capacity. Unfortunately, existing LLM serving systems, optimized for compute-bound workloads, fail to handle these memory-intensive operations effectively. Even with Processing-In-Memory (PIM) technology, current single-level memory designs cannot simultaneously satisfy the bandwidth and capacity requirements.\n  To address these challenges, we propose Processing Across Memory (PAM), a KV-centric LLM serving system that coordinates heterogeneous PIM-enabled memory devices within a hierarchical architecture. PAM introduces a novel computing paradigm to balance high memory bandwidth with scalable capacity. First, PAM exploits the inherent context locality in KV access patterns to intelligently distribute KV tokens across the memory hierarchy. Second, to further exploit context locality, it introduces the PAMattention algorithm, enabling fine-grained parallel attention computation across heterogeneous PIM devices. Finally, PAM incorporates an intra-device KV mapping, inter-device KV migration interface, and an inter-device online KV scheduling algorithm to dynamically balance computational workloads. By addressing both bandwidth and capacity demands simultaneously, PAM significantly enhances the efficiency and scalability of LLM serving systems, paving the way for cost-effective, high-performance solutions in the era of large-scale AI."}

However, existing state-of-the-art frameworks often overlook the stringent resource constraints of edge devices. To address this limitation, we propose MING, an Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR)-based framework that abstracts and automates the HLS design process. Within this framework, we adopt a streaming architecture with carefully managed buffers, specifically designed to handle resource constraints while ensuring low-latency. In comparison with recent frameworks, our approach achieves on average 15x speedup for standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) kernels with up to four layers, and up to 200x for single-layer kernels.

We theorize debugging as a structured, iterative diagnostic process in which programmers update a mental model of the system to guide information gathering. Developers gather information by alternating between navigation and execution strategies, employing forward and backward tracing modes of reasoning and adapting these approaches according to codebase context, complexity, and familiarity. Developers also gather external resources to complement code-based evidence, with their experience enabling them to systematically construct a mental model.

While existing multi-region load balancers save prefill computation by prioritizing Key--Value (KV) Cache hit rate, they ignore cluster networking latency, a critical factor in routing decisions. We introduce GORGO, a method for minimizing TTFT by optimizing a total serving cost as a function of available compute, network latency, and prefix caching. Using extensive profiling on custom infrastructure, we analyze component-level latency bottlenecks and benchmark GORGO against three baselines: (1) naive least-load routing, which ignores prefix-cache overlap; (2) prefix-similarity routing, which selectively pushes requests to the replica with the highest cached-prefix overlap; and (3) a centralized HTTP proxy that runs the GORGO policy while tracking requests across all nodes. We demonstrate that GORGO reduces P99 TTFT through network-aware routing and improves average TTFT by preventing pathological cross-region forwarding. Additionally, we find that GORGO-proxy overcomes synchronization overhead in previous methods and is 2.5x faster on median TTFT, demonstrating the success of a centralized router."}

Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches often borrow strategies from NLP, relying on chunking-based indexing and similarity-based retrieval. Chunking results in the loss of coherence between code units and overlooks structural relationships, while similarity-driven methods frequently miss functionally relevant dependencies such as helper functions, classes, or global variables. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a repository-level code generation framework that treats code as structured code rather than natural language. Our approach introduces (i) a structure-aware indexing strategy that represents repositories as hierarchical trees of functions, classes, and variables, preserving code structure and dependencies, (ii) a lightweight dependency-aware retriever (DAR) that explicitly identifies and retrieves the true dependencies required by a target function, and (iii) a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines DAR with similarity-based retrieval to provide both essential building blocks and practical usage examples. Extensive experiments on the challenging DevEval and RepoExec benchmarks, both requiring function implementation from real-world repositories with complex large repository context, show that Hydra achieves state-of-the-art performance across open- and closed-source CodeLLMs. Notably, our method establishes a new state of the art in repository-level code generation, surpassing strongest baseline by over 5% in Pass@1 and even enabling smaller models to match or exceed the performance of much larger ones that rely on existing retrievers."}

We conducted an online survey with 198 OSS practitioners, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to capture contributors' perceptions of team dynamics. The results reveal that communication-related team dynamics such as responsiveness, tone, and clarity of replies are consistently prioritized across practitioners.

However, the probabilistic nature of language models can have inherent hallucinations. Therefore, given a detected inconsistency between the requirement and the web application, it is hard to distinguish whether it stems from the hallucination or a real application bug. Addressing this issue presents two core technical challenges: the implicit oracle inference challenge, where the agent must act as its own oracle to implicitly decide if the application's behavior is correct without guidance, and the probabilistic inference challenge, where an LLM's inconsistent reasoning undermines its trustworthiness as an oracle. Existing LLM-based approaches fail to capture such implicit oracles, either by treating any page navigation that doesn't crash as a success, or by checking each state in isolation, thus missing bugs dependent on context from prior steps.\n  We introduce WebTestPilot, an LLM-based agent designed to address these challenges. WebTestPilot uses (1) a symbolization layer which detects and symbolizes critical GUI elements on the web application into symbols (i.e., variables) and (2) translates natural language specification into a sequence of steps, each of which is equipped with inferred pre- and post-conditions over the symbols as an oracle. This oracle captures data, temporal, and causal dependencies, enabling the validation of implicit requirements. To advance research in this area, we build a benchmark of bug-injected web apps for evaluating NL-to-E2E testing. The results show that WebTestPilot achieves a task completion rate of 99%, with 96% precision and 96% recall in bug detection, outperforming the best baseline (+70 precision, +27 recall).

We design a RAG-pipeline and a two-layer prompting strategy that extract researched actionables (ReACTs): concise, evidence-linked recommendations mapping to specific OSS practices. In the first layer, we systematically explore open LLMs and prompting techniques, selecting the best-performing combination to derive candidate ReACTs from 829 ICSE and FSE papers.

Grounded in Cognitive Gap theory, we propose a taxonomy of four clarity levels: Detailed, Standard, Incomplete, and Ambiguous. We construct a rigorous dataset of 240 ecologically valid tasks across 25 applications, subject to strict review protocols. Furthermore, targeting evaluation in dynamic environments, we develop MUSE (Mobile User Satisfaction Evaluator), an automated framework utilizing an MLLM-as-a-judge multi-agent architecture. MUSE performs fine-grained auditing across three dimensions: Outcome Effectiveness, Execution Quality, and Interaction Quality. Empirical results on AmbiBench reveal the performance boundaries of SoTA agents across different clarity levels, quantify the gains derived from active interaction, and validate the strong correlation between MUSE and human judgment. This work redefines evaluation standards, laying the foundation for next-generation agents capable of truly understanding user intent."}

Achieving verifiable source code provenance in practice remains challenging. The most popular technique, called reproducible builds, requires difficult matching and reexecution of build toolchains and environments. We propose a novel approach to verifiable provenance based on compiling software with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). By executing a compiler within a zkVM, our system produces both the compiled output and a cryptographic proof attesting that the compilation was performed on the claimed source code with the claimed compiler. We implement a proof-of-concept implementation using the RISC Zero zkVM and the ChibiCC C compiler, and evaluate it on 200 synthetic programs as well as 31 OpenSSL and 21 libsodium source files. Our results show that zk-compilation is applicable to real-world software and provides strong security guarantees: all adversarial tests targeting compiler substitution, source tampering, output manipulation, and replay attacks are successfully blocked."}

When grammars evolve, textual instances that originally conformed to them may become outdated. While model-driven engineering provides many techniques for co-evolving models with metamodel changes, these approaches are not designed for textual DSLs and may lose human-relevant information such as layout and comments. This study systematically evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) for co-evolving grammars and instances of textual DSLs. Using Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.2 across ten case languages with ten runs each, we assess both correctness and preservation of human-oriented information. Results show strong performance on small-scale cases ($\\geq$94% precision and recall for instances requiring fewer than 20 modified lines), but performance degraded with scale: Claude maintains 85% recall at 40 lines, while GPT fails on the largest instances. Response time increases substantially with instance size, and grammar evolution complexity and deletion granularity affect performance more than change type. These findings clarify when LLM-based co-evolution is effective and where current limitations remain."}

While effective for mainstream languages, they may underperform on less common or domain-specific languages, prompting companies to develop in-house code generators. While open-source models can be trained for this, only LLMs with tens of billions of parameters match the performance of commercial tools, demanding costly training and deployment. Recent work proposed supporting code generation with smaller models (SLMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and using another SLM to select the most likely correct one. The most recent work in this area is the one by Sun et al. [29] presenting RankEF, a T5 model trained to rank code solutions using both execution-based and non-execution-based information. However, Sun et al. do not assess the T5 ranker's classification accuracy, that is, how often it misjudges correct implementations as incorrect or vice versa, leaving open questions about the reliability of LMs as code correctness judges for other tasks (e.g., automated code review). Moreover, their experiments involve relatively old models, making it unclear the extent to which such a methodology would still help companies in cheaply training their own code generators with performance comparable to those of massive LLMs. We present a study addressing these limitations. We train several state-of-the-art SLMs as code correctness judges and assess their ability to discriminate between correct and wrong implementations. We show that modern SLMs outperform RankEF, even without exploiting execution-based information. When used as code rankers, they achieve higher performance gains than RankEF and perform competitively with LLMs 5-25x larger, at a fraction of the cost."}

Still, it is unclear the extent to which these approaches can recommend quality improvements as a human reviewer. We study the similarities and differences between code reviews performed by humans and those automatically generated by DL models, using ChatGPT-4 as representative of the latter. In particular, we run a mining-based study in which we collect and manually inspect 739 comments posted by human reviewers to suggest code changes in 240 PRs. The manual inspection aims at classifying the type of quality improvement recommended by human reviewers (e.g., rename variable/constant). Then, we ask ChatGPT to perform a code review on the same PRs and we compare the quality improvements it recommends against those suggested by the human reviewers. We show that while, on average, ChatGPT tends to recommend a higher number of code changes as compared to human reviewers (~2.4x more), it can only spot 10% of the quality issues reported by humans. However, ~40% of the additional comments generated by the LLM point to meaningful quality issues. In short, our findings show the complementarity of manual and AI-based code review. This finding suggests that, in its current state, DL-based code review can be used as a further quality check on top of the one performed by humans, but should not be considered as a valid alternative to them nor as a mean to save code review time, since human reviewers would still need to perform their manual inspection while also validating the quality issues reported by the DL-based technique."}

Although this practice is strongly encouraged by agent developers, there is currently no rigorous investigation into whether such context files are actually effective for real-world tasks. In this work, we study this question and evaluate coding agents' task completion performance in two complementary settings: established SWE-bench tasks from popular repositories, with LLM-generated context files following agent-developer recommendations, and a novel collection of issues from repositories containing developer-committed context files.\n  Across multiple coding agents and LLMs, we find that context files tend to reduce task success rates compared to providing no repository context, while also increasing inference cost by over 20%. Behaviorally, both LLM-generated and developer-provided context files encourage broader exploration (e.g., more thorough testing and file traversal), and coding agents tend to respect their instructions. Ultimately, we conclude that unnecessary requirements from context files make tasks harder, and human-written context files should describe only minimal requirements."}

Nowadays, deep learning (DL) is the most promising technique to automate this detection task, leveraging its superior ability to extract patterns and representations within extensive code volumes. Despite its promise, DL-based vulnerability detection remains in its early stages, with model performance exhibiting variability across datasets. Drawing insights from other well-explored application areas like computer vision, we conjecture that the imbalance issue (the number of vulnerable code is extremely small) is at the core of the phenomenon. To validate this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study involving nine open-source datasets and two state-of-the-art DL models. The results confirm our conjecture. We also obtain insightful findings on how existing imbalance solutions perform in vulnerability detection. It turns out that these solutions perform differently as well across datasets and evaluation metrics. Specifically: 1) Focal loss is more suitable to improve the precision, 2) mean false error and class-balanced loss encourages the recall, and 3) random over-sampling facilitates the F1-measure. However, none of them excels across all metrics. To delve deeper, we explore external influences on these solutions and offer insights for developing new solutions."}

These difficulties stem from the limited explainability of raw model-checker output and the substantial manual effort required to trace violations back to source specifications. Although the TLA+ Toolbox includes a state diagram viewer, it offers only a static, fully expanded graph without folding, color highlighting, or semantic explanations, which limits its scalability and interpretability. We present ModelWisdom, an interactive environment that uses visualization and large language models to make TLA+ model checking more interpretable and actionable. ModelWisdom offers: (i) Model Visualization, with colorized violation highlighting, click-through links from transitions to TLA+ code, and mapping between violating states and broken properties; (ii) Graph Optimization, including tree-based structuring and node/edge folding to manage large models; (iii) Model Digest, which summarizes and explains subgraphs via large language models (LLMs) and performs preprocessing and partial explanations; and (iv) Model Repair, which extracts error information and supports iterative debugging. Together, these capabilities turn raw model-checker output into an interactive, explainable workflow, improving understanding and reducing debugging effort for nontrivial TLA+ specifications.

This paper empirically investigates whether widely studied performance antipatterns defined by Smith and Williams also negatively influence power usage. We implement ten antipatterns as isolated microservices and evaluate them under controlled load conditions, collecting synchronized measurements of performance, CPU and DRAM power consumption, and resource utilization across 30 repeated runs per antipattern. The results show that while all antipatterns degrade performance as expected, only a subset exhibit a statistically significant relationship between response time and increased power consumption. Specifically, several antipatterns reach CPU saturation, capping power draw regardless of rising response time, whereas others (\\eg Unnecessary Processing, The Ramp) demonstrate energy-performance coupling indicative of inefficiency. Our results show that, while all injected performance antipatterns increase response time as expected, only a subset also behaves as clear energy antipatterns, with several cases reaching a nearly constant CPU power level where additional slowdowns mainly translate into longer execution time rather than higher instantaneous power consumption. The study provides a systematic foundation for identifying performance antipatterns that also behave as energy antipatterns and offers actionable insights for designing more energy-efficient microservices architectures."}

We analyzed PR acceptance behaviors across mobile platforms, agents, and task categories using 2,901 AI-authored pull requests (PRs) in 193 verified Android and iOS open-source GitHub repositories in the AIDev dataset. We find that Android projects have received 2x more AI-authored PRs and have achieved higher PR acceptance rate (71%) than iOS (63%), with significant agent-level variation on Android. Across task categories, PRs with routine tasks (feature, fix, and ui) achieve the highest acceptance, while structural changes like refactor and build achieve lower success and longer resolution times. Furthermore, our evolution analysis shows improvement in PR resolution time on Android through mid-2025 before it declined again.

Unit tests generated by tools that employ traditional approaches, such as search-based software testing (SBST), lack readability, naturalness, and practical usability. LLMs have recently provided promising results and become integral to developers' daily practices. Consequently, software repositories now include a mix of human-written tests, LLM-generated tests, and those from tools employing traditional approaches such as SBST. While LLMs' zero-shot capabilities have been widely studied, their few-shot learning potential for unit test generation remains underexplored. Few-shot prompting enables LLMs to learn from examples in the prompt, and automatically retrieving such examples could enhance test suites. This paper empirically investigates how few-shot prompting with different test artifact sources, comprising human, SBST, or LLM, affects the quality of LLM-generated unit tests as program comprehension artifacts and their contribution to improving existing test suites by evaluating not only correctness and coverage but also readability, cognitive complexity, and maintainability in hybrid human-AI codebases. We conducted experiments on HumanEval and ClassEval datasets using GPT-4o, which is integrated into GitHub Copilot and widely used among developers. We also assessed retrieval-based methods for selecting relevant examples. Our results show that LLMs can generate high-quality tests via few-shot prompting, with human-written examples producing the best coverage and correctness. Additionally, selecting examples based on the combined similarity of problem description and code consistently yields the most effective few-shot prompts."}

This article presents a concrete architecture for a distributed rate limiting system in a production-grade environment. Our design chooses the in-memory cache database, the Redis, along with its Sorted Set data structure, which provides $O(log (N))$ time complexity operation for the key-value pair dataset with efficiency and low latency, and maintains precision. The core contribution is quantifying the accuracy and memory cost trade-off of the chosen Rolling Window as the implemented rate limiting algorithm against the Token Bucket and Fixed Window algorithms. In addition, we explain how server-side Lua scripting is critical to bundling cleanup, counting, and insertion into a single atomic operation, thereby eliminating race conditions in concurrent environments. In the system architecture, we propose a three-layer architecture that manages the storage and updating of the limit rules. Through script load by hashing the rule parameters, rules can be changed without modifying the cached scripts. Furthermore, we analyze the deployment of this architecture on a Redis Cluster, which provides the availability and scalability by data sharding and replication. We explain the acceptance of AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) from the CAP theorem as the pragmatic engineering trade-off for this use case."}
