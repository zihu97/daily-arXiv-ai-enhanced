Due to this availability, many\nfree and open-source implementations have been developed and can be accessed on\nplatforms such as GitHub. If an open source, easy-to-use, and robust RISC-V\nimplementation could be obtained, it could be easily adapted for pedagogical\nand amateur use. In this work we accomplish three goals in relation to this\noutlook. First, we propose a set of criteria for evaluating the components of a\nRISC-V implementation's ecosystem from a pedagogical perspective. Second, we\nanalyze a number of existing open-source RISC-V implementations to determine\nhow many of the criteria they fulfill. We then develop a comprehensive solution\nthat meets all of these criterion and is released open-source for other\ninstructors to use. The framework is developed in a composable way that it's\ndifferent components can be disaggregated per individual course needs. Finally,\nwe also report on a limited study of student feedback."}

Most often, silicon\ncharacterizations comprise simple performance counters, which are aggregated\nand separated to tell a story. Based on these inferences, performance engineers\nemploy microarchitectural simulation to inspect deeply into the core.\nUnfortunately, dramatically longer runtimes make simulation infeasible for long\nworkloads.\n  We propose a Scale-Down approach to modelling and validation. Rather than\nup-sizing a prototyping platform to fit large and complex system designs, we\nshow that it can be more accurate, faster, and more economical to decompose a\nsystem into manageable sub-components that can be prototyped independently. By\ncarefully designing the prototyping interface, it is possible to adhere to\nstrict non-interference of the Device Under Test (DUT). This allows architects\nto have the best of both worlds: the speed of FPGA acceleration while\neliminating the inaccuracies of Scale-Out and the inherent costs of Scale-Up.\n  In this work, we present ZynqParrot: a Scale-Down FPGA-based modelling\nplatform, capable of executing non-interfering, cycle-accurate co-emulations of\narbitrary RTL designs. ZynqParrot is capable of verifying functionality and\nperformance with arbitrary granularity.

To effectively leverage\nadvancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate\nrepresentation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment,\nretrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface\nfor external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data\nof natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization\ninterface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale\ndata collection for future development.

Hence, network\nmanagement must be automated with the help of Machine Learning (ML) and\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve real-time requirements. Zero touch\nnetwork (ZTN) is one of the frameworks to automate network management with\nmechanisms such as closed loop control to ensure that the goals are met\nperpetually. Intent- Based Networking (IBN) specifies the user intents with\ndiverse network requirements or goals which are then translated into specific\nnetwork configurations and actions. This paper presents a novel architecture\nfor integrating IBN and ZTN to serve the intent goals. Users provides the\nintent in the form of natural language, e.g., English, which is then translated\nusing natural language processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., retrieval augmented\ngeneration (RAG)) into Network Intent LanguagE (Nile). The Nile intent is then\npassed on to the BiLSTM and Q-learning based ZTN closed loop framework as a\ngoal which maintains the intent under varying network conditions. Thus, the\nproposed architecture can work autonomously to ensure the network performance\ngoal is met by just specifying the user intent in English. The integrated\narchitecture is also implemented on a testbed using OpenAirInterface (OAI).\nAdditionally, to evaluate the architecture, an optimization problem is\nformulated which evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results demonstrate\nhow ZTN can help achieve the bandwidth goals autonomously set by user intent.\nThe simulation and the testbed results are compared and they show similar\ntrend.

RePro combines few-shot in-context\nlearning with Structured and Semantic Chain of Thought (SCoT/SeCoT) techniques\nto systematically translate a paper's description into an optimized, executable\nimplementation.

A\ncritical operation in edge inference is for an edge node (EN) to aggregate\nmulti-view sensory features extracted by distributed agents, thereby boosting\nperception accuracy. Over-the-air computing (AirComp) emerges as a promising\ntechnique for rapid feature aggregation by exploiting the waveform\nsuperposition property of analog-modulated signals, which is, however,\nincompatible with existing digital communication systems. Meanwhile, hybrid\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a novel RIS architecture capable of\nsimultaneous signal amplification and reflection, exhibits potential for\nenhancing AirComp. Therefore, this paper proposes a Hybrid RIS-aided Digital\nAirComp (HRD-AirComp) scheme, which employs vector quantization to map\nhigh-dimensional features into discrete codewords that are digitally modulated\ninto symbols for wireless transmission. By judiciously adjusting the AirComp\ntransceivers and hybrid RIS reflection to control signal superposition across\nagents, the EN can estimate the aggregated features from the received signals.\nTo endow HRD-AirComp with a task-oriented design principle, we derive a\nsurrogate function for inference accuracy that characterizes the impact of\nfeature quantization and over-the-air aggregation. Based on this surrogate, we\nformulate an optimization problem targeting inference accuracy maximization,\nand develop an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize the quantization bit\nallocation, agent transmission coefficients, EN receiving beamforming, and\nhybrid RIS reflection beamforming. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed HRD-AirComp outperforms baselines in terms of both inference accuracy\nand uncertainty."}

Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can\ninterpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment\non edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM\ninference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from\nedge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential\ndelays that compromise real-time performance.

Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)\nusing YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into\ncompact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings\nare then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the\ncropped images.
