Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) centers consume substantial power, incurring environmental and operational costs. This review assesses how artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML) and optimization, improves the efficiency of operational HPC systems. Approximately 1,800 publications from 2019 to 2025 were manually screened using predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria; 74 "AI for HPC" papers were retained and grouped into six application areas: performance estimation, performance optimization, scheduling, surrogate modeling, fault detection, and language-model-based automation.
  Scheduling is the most active area, spanning research-oriented reinforcement-learning schedulers to production-friendly hybrids that combine ML with heuristics. Supervised performance estimation is foundational for both scheduling and optimization. Graph neural networks and time-series models strengthen anomaly detection by capturing spatio-temporal dependencies in production telemetry. Domain-specialized language models for HPC can outperform general-purpose LLMs on targeted coding and automation tasks. Together, these findings highlight integration opportunities such as LLM-based operating-system concepts and underscore the need for advances in MLOps, standardization of AI components, and benchmarking methodology.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training over privacy-sensitive, distributed data, but its environmental impact is difficult to compare across studies due to inconsistent measurement boundaries and heterogeneous reporting. We present a practical carbon-accounting methodology for FL CO2e tracking using NVIDIA NVFlare and CodeCarbon for explicit, phase-aware tasks (initialization, per-round training, evaluation, and idle/coordination). To capture non-compute effects, we additionally estimate communication emissions from transmitted model-update sizes under a network-configurable energy model. We validate the proposed approach on two representative workloads: CIFAR-10 image classification and retinal optic disk segmentation. In CIFAR-10, controlled client-efficiency scenarios show that system-level slowdowns and coordination effects can contribute meaningfully to carbon footprint under an otherwise fixed FL protocol, increasing total CO2e by 8.34x (medium) and 21.73x (low) relative to the high-efficiency baseline. In retinal segmentation, swapping GPU tiers (H100 vs.\ V100) yields a consistent 1.7x runtime gap (290 vs. 503 minutes) while producing non-uniform changes in total energy and CO2e across sites, underscoring the need for per-site and per-round reporting. Overall, our results support a standardized carbon accounting method that acts as a prerequisite for reproducible 'green' FL evaluation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pediatric-Accelerated-Intelligence-Lab/carbon_footprint.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Safra's distributed termination detection algorithm employs a logical token ring structure within a distributed network; only passive nodes forward the token, and a counter in the token keeps track of the number of sent minus the number of received messages. We adapt this classic algorithm to make it fault-tolerant. The counter is split into counters per node, to discard counts from crashed nodes. If a node crashes, the token ring is restored locally and a backup token is sent. Nodes inform each other of detected crashes via the token. Our algorithm imposes no additional message overhead, tolerates any number of crashes as well as simultaneous crashes, and copes with crashes in a decentralized fashion. Correctness proofs are provided of both the original Safra's algorithm and its fault-tolerant variant, as well as a model checking analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large-scale training systems typically use synchronous training, requiring all GPUs to be healthy simultaneously. In our experience training on O(100K) GPUs, synchronous training results in a low efficiency due to frequent failures and long recovery time.
  To address this problem, we propose a novel training paradigm, Fault Tolerant Hybrid-Shared Data Parallelism (FT-HSDP). FT-HSDP uses data parallel replicas as units of fault tolerance. When failures occur, only a single data-parallel replica containing the failed GPU or server is taken offline and restarted, while the other replicas continue training. To realize this idea at scale, FT-HSDP incorporates several techniques: 1) We introduce a Fault Tolerant All Reduce (FTAR) protocol for gradient exchange across data parallel replicas. FTAR relies on the CPU to drive the complex control logic for tasks like adding or removing participants dynamically, and relies on GPU to perform data transfer for best performance. 2) We introduce a non-blocking catch-up protocol, allowing a recovering replica to join training with minimal stall.
  Compared with fully synchronous training at O(100K) GPUs, FT-HSDP can reduce the stall time due to failure recovery from 10 minutes to 3 minutes, increasing effective training time from 44\% to 80\%. We further demonstrate that FT-HSDP's asynchronous recovery does not bring any meaning degradation to the accuracy of the result model.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models have become a dominant architecture for scaling Large Language Models by activating only a sparse subset of experts per token. However, latency-critical MoE inference faces a fundamental tension: while expert parallelism improves memory efficiency, it also amplifies execution stragglers. In real-world serving, continuous batching and diverse concurrent requests induce rapid semantic shifts, causing expert hotspots to migrate abruptly across GPUs and triggering the 'double penalty' of coupled computational skew and network congestion.
  We propose PROBE, an inference system that co-balances computation and communication in real time. PROBE introduces Continuous Lookahead Pipelining, which proactively predicts, plans, and prefetches for upcoming layers while keeping all control overheads off the critical path. PROBE consists of: (1) a Gate-Initialized Lookahead Predictor that distills the target router to forecast next-layer expert activation with high fidelity; (2) a Hardware-Aware Balance Planning solver that jointly optimizes dynamic expert replication and token assignment under strict hiding-window constraints; and (3) a Phase-Locked Co-Scheduling policy that uses split-phase transmission to hide bandwidth-intensive expert transfers behind computation without contending with All-to-All collectives. Experiments show that PROBE reduces prefill latency by up to 1.32X and improves decoding throughput by up to 1.26X over state-of-the-art baselines, especially under extreme workload volatility.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) towards long-context reasoning and sparse architectures has pushed memory requirements far beyond the capacity of individual device HBM. While emerging supernode architectures offer terabyte-scale shared memory pools via high-bandwidth interconnects, existing software stacks fail to exploit this hardware effectively. Current runtime-based offloading and swapping techniques operate with a local view, leading to reactive scheduling and exposed communication latency that stall the computation pipeline.
  In this paper, we propose the SuperNode Memory Management Framework (\textbf{HyperOffload}). It employs a compiler-assisted approach that leverages graph-driven memory management to treat remote memory access as explicit operations in the computation graph, specifically designed for hierarchical SuperNode architectures. Unlike reactive runtime systems, SuperNode represents data movement using cache operators within the compiler's Intermediate Representation (IR). This design enables a global, compile-time analysis of tensor lifetimes and execution dependencies. Leveraging this visibility, we develop a global execution-order refinement algorithm that statically schedules data transfers to hide remote memory latency behind compute-intensive regions. We implement SuperNode within the production deep learning framework MindSpore, adding a remote memory backend and specialized compiler passes. Evaluation on representative LLM workloads shows that SuperNode reduces peak device memory usage by up to 26\% for inference while maintaining end-to-end performance. Our work demonstrates that integrating memory-augmented hardware into the compiler's optimization framework is essential for scaling next-generation AI workloads.

Abstract: Photonic in-memory computing is a high-speed, low-energy alternative to traditional transistor-based digital computing that utilizes high photonic operating frequencies and bandwidths. In this work, we develop a comprehensive system-level performance model for photonic in-memory computing, capturing the effects of key latency sources such as external memory access and opto-electronic conversion. We perform algorithm-to-hardware mapping across a range of workloads, including the Sod shock tube problem, Matricized Tensor Times Khatri-Rao Product (MTTKRP), and the Vlasov-Maxwell equation, to evaluate how the latencies impact real-world high-performance computing workloads. Our performance model shows that, while accounting for system overheads, a compact 1x256 bit single-wavelength photonic SRAM array, fabricated using the standard silicon photonics process by GlobalFoundries, sustains up to 1.5 TOPS, 0.9 TOPS, and 1.3 TOPS on the Sod shock tube problem, MTTKRP, and the Vlasov-Maxwell equation with an average energy efficiency of 2.5 TOPS/W.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in demand for GPUs to train Machine Learning (ML) models. Because it is prohibitively expensive for most organizations to build and maintain a large GPU cluster, organizations instead choose to rent GPUs from cloud providers. The customer is responsible for devising a policy for (i) deciding how many GPUs to rent at every moment in time to process a stream of ML training jobs and (ii) allocating the rented GPUs among the currently active jobs in the system. Because ML training jobs can be parallelized across different numbers of GPUs, the customer generally has many options for how many GPUs to use for each job. Allocating more GPUs to a single training job will cause the job to complete more quickly. However, the customer pays for each GPU-hour they use, and a training job receives a diminishing marginal benefit from running on additional GPUs. Hence, allocating too many GPUs to a single training job can dramatically increase the overall cost that the customer pays to the cloud provider. This gives rise to a cost-performance tradeoff that customers must balance when running training jobs in the cloud.
  To balance the cost-performance tradeoff, we develop BOA Constrictor, a new scheduler for ML training jobs which uses a Budget-Optimal Allocation (BOA) policy to squeeze the highest level of performance out of a cloud-deployed GPU cluster given a fixed budget constraint. We explicitly formulate the problem as a budget-constrained scheduling problem and derive the BOA policy which minimizes the average job completion time (JCT) of a stream of arriving jobs subject to the user's budget. For a given budget level, we demonstrate that BOA Constrictor can reduce average JCT by 1.6 times in small-scale implementation experiments and by 2 times in detailed, large-scale simulations compared to state-of-the-art heuristic based schedulers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern data centers and cloud computing clusters are increasingly running workloads composed of malleable jobs. A malleable job can be parallelized across any number of cores, yet the job typically exhibits diminishing marginal returns for each additional core on which it runs. This can be seen in the concavity of a job's speedup function, which describes the job's processing speed as a function of the number of cores on which it runs.
  Given the prevalence of malleable jobs, several theoretical works have posed the problem of how to allocate a fixed number of cores across a stream of arriving malleable jobs so as to minimize the mean response time across jobs. We refer to this as the Core Allocation to Malleable jobs (CAM) problem. We solve the CAM problem under a highly general setting, allowing for multiple job classes, each with an arbitrary concave speedup function and holding costs (weight). Furthermore, we allow for generally distributed inter-arrival times and job sizes.
  We analyze the CAM problem in the mean field asymptotic regime and derive two distinct mean field optimal policies, FW-CAM and WHAM. FW-CAM is interesting because it demonstrates a new intuition: in the mean field regime, job sizes are not relevant in finding an optimal policy. WHAM (Whittle Allocation for Malleable jobs) is interesting because it is asymptotically optimal and also serves as a good heuristic even outside of the asymptotic regime. Notably, none of the policies previously proposed in the literature are mean field optimal when jobs may follow different speedup functions.

Abstract: In recent years, the monitoring and study of natural hazards have gained significant attention, particularly due to climate change, which exacerbates incidents like floods, droughts, storm surges, and landslides. Together with the constant risk of earthquakes, these climate-induced events highlight the critical necessity for enhanced risk assessment and mitigation strategies in susceptible areas such as Italy.
  In this work, we present a Science Gateway framework for the development of portable and fully automated post-event analysis pipelines integrating Photogrammetry techniques, Data Visualization and Artificial Intelligence technologies, applied on aerial images, to assess extreme natural events and evaluate their impact on risk-exposed assets.

Abstract: Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Any-to-any multimodal models that jointly handle text, images, video, and audio represent a significant advance in multimodal AI. However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods. The code is public available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni.

Abstract: State-of-the-art AI deep potentials provide ab initio-quality results, but at a fraction of the computational cost of first-principles quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory. In this work, we bring AI deep potentials into GROMACS, a production-level Molecular Dynamics (MD) code, by integrating with DeePMD-kit that provides domain-specific deep learning (DL) models of interatomic potential energy and force fields. In particular, we enable AI deep potentials inference across multiple DP model families and DL backends by coupling GROMACS Neural Network Potentials with the C++/CUDA backend in DeePMD-kit. We evaluate two recent large-atom-model architectures, DPA2 that is based on the attention mechanism and DPA3 that is based on GNN, in GROMACS using four ab initio-quality protein-in-water benchmarks (1YRF, 1UBQ, 3LZM, 2PTC) on NVIDIA A100 and GH200 GPUs. Our results show that DPA2 delivers up to 4.23x and 3.18x higher throughput than DPA3 on A100 and GH200 GPUs, respectively. We also provide a characterization study to further contrast DPA2 and DPA3 in throughput, memory usage, and kernel-level execution on GPUs. Our findings identify kernel-launch overhead and domain-decomposed inference as the main optimization priorities for AI deep potentials in production MD simulations.

Abstract: Lakehouses are the default cloud platform for analytics and AI, but they become unsafe when untrusted actors concurrently operate on production data: upstream-downstream mismatches surface only at runtime, and multi-table pipelines can leak partial effects. Inspired by software engineering, we design Bauplan, a code-first lakehouse that aims to make (most) illegal states unrepresentable using familiar abstractions. Bauplan acts along three axes: typed table contracts to make pipeline boundaries checkable, Git-like data versioning for review and reproducibility, and transactional runs that guarantee pipeline-level atomicity. We report early results from a lightweight formal transaction model and discuss future work motivated by counterexamples.

Abstract: The study of Locally Checkable Labelings (LCLs) has led to a remarkably precise characterization of the distributed time complexities that can occur on bounded-degree trees. A central feature of this complexity landscape is the existence of strong gap results, which rule out large ranges of intermediate complexities. While it was initially hoped that these gaps might extend to more general graph classes, this has turned out not to be the case. In this work, we investigate a different direction: we remain in the class of trees, but allow arbitrarily large degrees.
  We focus on the polynomial regime ($Θ(n^{1/k} \mid k \in \mathbb{N})$) and show that whether polynomial gap results persist in the unbounded-degree setting crucially depends on how LCLs are generalized beyond bounded degrees. We first demonstrate that if one allows LCLs to be defined using infinitely many local configurations, then the polynomial gaps disappear entirely: for every real exponent $0 < r \leq 1$, there exists a locally checkable problem on trees with deterministic LOCAL complexity $Θ(n^r)$.
  Rather than stopping at this negative result, we identify a natural class of problems for which polynomial gap results can still be recovered. We introduce Locally Finite Labelings (LFLs), which formalize the intuition that ''every node must fall into one of finitely many local cases'', even in the presence of unbounded degrees.
  Our main result shows that this restriction is sufficient to restore the polynomial gaps: for any LFL $Π$ on trees with unbounded degrees, the deterministic LOCAL complexity of $Π$ is either
  - $Θ(n^{1/k})$ for some integer $k \geq 1$, or
  - $O(\log n)$.
  Moreover, which case applies, and the corresponding value of $k$, can be determined solely from the description of $Π$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has emerged as a key architecture for large-scale wireless and Internet of Things systems, where devices communicate with nearby edge servers before reaching the cloud. In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose sVIRGO, a scalable virtual tree hierarchical framework for large-scale distributed systems. sVIRGO constructs virtual hierarchical trees directly on physical nodes, allowing each node to assume multiple hierarchical roles without overlay networks. The hierarchy preserves locality and is organized into configurable layers within regions. Coordination across thousands of regions is achieved via virtual upper-layer roles dynamically mapped onto nodes up to the top layer.
  Each region maintains multiple active coordinators that monitor local health and perform dynamic re-selection if failures occur. Temporary drops below the minimum threshold do not compromise coordination, ensuring near-zero recovery latency, bounded communication overhead, and exponentially reduced failure probability while maintaining safety, liveness, and robustness under mobile, interference-prone, or adversarial conditions.
  Communication is decoupled from the hierarchy and may use multi-frequency wireless links. Two message hop strategies are supported: (i) with long-distance infrastructure-assisted channels, coordinators exploit the virtual tree to minimize hops; (ii) without such channels, messages propagate via adjacent regions.
  sVIRGO also supports Layer-Scoped Command Execution. Commands and coordination actions are executed within the scope of each hierarchical layer, enabling efficient local and regional decision-making while limiting unnecessary global propagation.

Abstract: Constitutional AI has focused on single-model alignment using fixed principles. However, multi-agent systems create novel alignment challenges through emergent social dynamics. We present Constitutional Evolution, a framework for automatically discovering behavioral norms in multi-agent LLM systems. Using a grid-world simulation with survival pressure, we study the tension between individual and collective welfare, quantified via a Societal Stability Score S in [0,1] that combines productivity, survival, and conflict metrics. Adversarial constitutions lead to societal collapse (S= 0), while vague prosocial principles ("be helpful, harmless, honest") produce inconsistent coordination (S = 0.249). Even constitutions designed by Claude 4.5 Opus with explicit knowledge of the objective achieve only moderate performance (S= 0.332). Using LLM-driven genetic programming with multi-island evolution, we evolve constitutions maximizing social welfare without explicit guidance toward cooperation. The evolved constitution C* achieves S = 0.556 +/- 0.008 (123% higher than human-designed baselines, N = 10), eliminates conflict, and discovers that minimizing communication (0.9% vs 62.2% social actions) outperforms verbose coordination. Our interpretable rules demonstrate that cooperative norms can be discovered rather than prescribed.

Abstract: The evolution of next-Generation (xG) wireless networks marks a paradigm shift from connectivity-centric architectures to Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native designs that tightly integrate data, computing, and communication. Yet existing AI deployments in communication systems remain largely siloed, offering isolated optimizations without intrinsic adaptability, dynamic task delegation, or multi-agent collaboration. In this work, we propose a unified agentic NetGPT framework for AI-native xG networks, wherein a NetGPT core can either perform autonomous reasoning or delegate sub-tasks to domain-specialized agents via agentic communication. The framework establishes clear modular responsibilities and interoperable workflows, enabling scalable, distributed intelligence across the network. To support continual refinement of collaborative reasoning strategies, the framework is further enhanced through Agentic reinforcement learning under partially observable conditions and stochastic external states. The training pipeline incorporates masked loss against external agent uncertainty, entropy-guided exploration, and multi-objective rewards that jointly capture task quality, coordination efficiency, and resource constraints. Through this process, NetGPT learns when and how to collaborate, effectively balancing internal reasoning with agent invocation. Overall, this work provides a foundational architecture and training methodology for self-evolving, AI-native xG networks capable of autonomous sensing, reasoning, and action in complex communication environments.

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model systems can tackle complex multi-step tasks by decomposing work and coordinating specialized behaviors. However, current coordination mechanisms typically rely on statically assigned roles and centralized controllers. As agent pools and task distributions evolve, these design choices lead to inefficient routing, poor adaptability, and fragile fault recovery capabilities. We introduce Symphony-Coord, a decentralized multi-agent framework that transforms agent selection into an online multi-armed bandit problem, enabling roles to emerge organically through interaction. The framework employs a two-stage dynamic beacon protocol: (i) a lightweight candidate screening mechanism to limit communication and computational overhead; (ii) an adaptive LinUCB selector that routes subtasks based on context features derived from task requirements and agent states, continuously optimized through delayed end-to-end feedback. Under standard linear realizability assumptions, we provide sublinear regret bounds, indicating the system converges toward near-optimal allocation schemes. Validation through simulation experiments and real-world large language model benchmarks demonstrates that Symphony-Coord not only enhances task routing efficiency but also exhibits robust self-healing capabilities in scenarios involving distribution shifts and agent failures, achieving a scalable coordination mechanism without predefined roles.

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM systems are increasingly deployed as autonomous collaborators, where agents interact freely rather than execute fixed, pre-specified workflows. In such settings, effective coordination cannot be fully designed in advance and must instead emerge through interaction. However, most prior work enforces coordination through fixed roles, workflows, or aggregation rules, leaving open the question of how well self-organizing teams perform when coordination is unconstrained. Drawing on organizational psychology, we study whether self-organizing LLM teams achieve strong synergy, where team performance matches or exceeds the best individual member. Across human-inspired and frontier ML benchmarks, we find that -- unlike human teams -- LLM teams consistently fail to match their expert agent's performance, even when explicitly told who the expert is, incurring performance losses of up to 37.6%. Decomposing this failure, we show that expert leveraging, rather than identification, is the primary bottleneck. Conversational analysis reveals a tendency toward integrative compromise -- averaging expert and non-expert views rather than appropriately weighting expertise -- which increases with team size and correlates negatively with performance. Interestingly, this consensus-seeking behavior improves robustness to adversarial agents, suggesting a trade-off between alignment and effective expertise utilization. Our findings reveal a significant gap in the ability of self-organizing multi-agent teams to harness the collective expertise of their members.

Abstract: Contemporary large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems exhibit systematic advantages in deep research tasks, which emphasize iterative, vertically structured information seeking. However, when confronted with wide search tasks characterized by large-scale, breadth-oriented retrieval, existing agentic frameworks, primarily designed around sequential, vertically structured reasoning, remain stuck in expansive search objectives and inefficient long-horizon execution. To bridge this gap, we propose A-MapReduce, a MapReduce paradigm-inspired multi-agent execution framework that recasts wide search as a horizontally structured retrieval problem. Concretely, A-MapReduce implements parallel processing of massive retrieval targets through task-adaptive decomposition and structured result aggregation. Meanwhile, it leverages experiential memory to drive the continual evolution of query-conditioned task allocation and recomposition, enabling progressive improvement in large-scale wide-search regimes. Extensive experiments on five agentic benchmarks demonstrate that A-MapReduce is (i) high-performing, achieving state-of-the-art performance on WideSearch and DeepWideSearch, and delivering 5.11% - 17.50% average Item F1 improvements compared with strong baselines with OpenAI o3 or Gemini 2.5 Pro backbones; (ii) cost-effective and efficient, delivering superior cost-performance trade-offs and reducing running time by 45.8\% compared to representative multi-agent baselines.

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM architectures offer opportunities for pedagogical agents to help students construct domain knowledge and develop critical-thinking skills, yet many operate on a "one-size-fits-all" basis, limiting their ability to provide personalized support. To address this, we introduce Evidence-Decision-Feedback (EDF), a theoretical framework for adaptive scaffolding using LLMs. EDF integrates elements of intelligent tutoring systems and agentic behavior by organizing interactions around evidentiary inference, pedagogical decision-making, and adaptive feedback. We instantiate EDF through Copa, an agentic collaborative peer agent for STEM+C problem-solving. In an authentic high school classroom study, we show that EDF-aligned interactions align feedback with students' demonstrated understanding and task mastery; promote gradual scaffold fading; and support interpretable, evidence-grounded explanations without fostering overreliance.

Abstract: The design of environments plays a critical role in shaping the development and evaluation of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. While existing benchmarks highlight critical challenges, they often lack the modularity required to design custom evaluation scenarios. We introduce the Totally Accelerated Battle Simulator in JAX (TABX), a high-throughput sandbox designed for reconfigurable multi-agent tasks. TABX provides granular control over environmental parameters, permitting a systematic investigation into emergent agent behaviors and algorithmic trade-offs across a diverse spectrum of task complexities. Leveraging JAX for hardware-accelerated execution on GPUs, TABX enables massive parallelization and significantly reduces computational overhead. By providing a fast, extensible, and easily customized framework, TABX facilitates the study of MARL agents in complex structured domains and serves as a scalable foundation for future research. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TABX-00CA.

Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems increasingly rely on internal coordination mechanisms to combine, arbitrate, or constrain the outputs of heterogeneous components. In safety-critical and regulated domains such as finance, these mechanisms must satisfy strict formal requirements, remain auditable, and operate within explicitly bounded limits. Coordination logic therefore functions as a governance layer rather than an optimization heuristic.
  This paper presents an exploratory systems feasibility study of Self-Evolving Coordination Protocols (SECP): coordination protocols that permit limited, externally validated self-modification while preserving fixed formal invariants. We study a controlled proof-of-concept setting in which six fixed Byzantine consensus protocol proposals are evaluated by six specialized decision modules. All coordination regimes operate under identical hard constraints, including Byzantine fault tolerance (f < n/3), O(n2) message complexity, complete non-statistical safety and liveness arguments, and bounded explainability.
  Four coordination regimes are compared in a single-shot design: unanimous hard veto, weighted scalar aggregation, SECP v1.0 (an agent-designed non-scalar protocol), and SECP v2.0 (the result of one governed modification). Outcomes are evaluated using a single metric, proposal coverage, defined as the number of proposals accepted. A single recursive modification increased coverage from two to three accepted proposals while preserving all declared invariants.
  The study makes no claims regarding statistical significance, optimality, convergence, or learning. Its contribution is architectural: it demonstrates that bounded self-modification of coordination protocols is technically implementable, auditable, and analyzable under explicit formal constraints, establishing a foundation for governed multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Electromigration (EM) induced stress evolution is a major reliability challenge in nanometer-scale VLSI interconnects. Accurate EM analysis requires solving stress-governing partial differential equations over large interconnect trees, which is computationally expensive using conventional finite-difference methods. This work proposes two fast EM stress analysis techniques based on rational Krylov subspace reduction. Unlike traditional Krylov methods that expand around zero frequency, rational Krylov methods enable expansion at selected time constants, aligning directly with metrics such as nucleation and steady-state times and producing compact reduced models with minimal accuracy loss. Two complementary frameworks are developed: a frequency-domain extended rational Krylov method, ExtRaKrylovEM, and a time-domain rational Krylov exponential integration method, EiRaKrylovEM. We show that the accuracy of both methods depends strongly on the choice of expansion point, or shift time, and demonstrate that effective shift times are typically close to times of interest such as nucleation or post-void steady state. Based on this observation, a coordinate descent optimization strategy is introduced to automatically determine optimal reduction orders and shift times for both nucleation and post-void phases. Experimental results on synthesized structures and industry-scale power grids show that the proposed methods achieve orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency and accuracy over finite-difference solutions. Using only 4 to 6 Krylov orders, the methods achieve sub-0.1 percent error in nucleation time and resistance change predictions while delivering 20 to 500 times speedup. In contrast, standard extended Krylov methods require more than 50 orders and still incur 10 to 20 percent nucleation time error, limiting their practicality for EM-aware optimization and stochastic EM analysis.

Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources has ushered in a host of complex challenges, significantly impacting power quality in distribution networks. This work studies these challenges, exploring issues such as voltage fluctuations and escalating power losses caused by the integration of solar systems and electric vehicle (EV) chargers. We present a robust methodology focused on mitigating voltage deviations and power losses, emphasizing the allocation of a Permitted Percentage (PP) of battery-based solar systems within residential areas endowed with storage capabilities. A key facet of this research lies in its adaptability to the changing landscape of electric transportation. With the rapid increase of electric trucks on the horizon, our proposed model gains relevance. By tactically deploying PP to oversee the charging and discharging of batteries within residential solar systems, utilities are poised not only to assist with grid resilience but also to cater to the upcoming demands spurred by the advent of new EVs, notably trucks. To validate the efficacy of our proposed model, rigorous simulations were conducted using the IEEE 33-bus distribution network as a designed testbed. Leveraging advanced Particle Swarm Optimization techniques, we have deciphered the optimal charging and discharging commands issued by utilities to energy storage systems. The outcomes of these simulations help us understand the transformative potential of various PP allocations, shedding light on the balance between non-battery-based and battery-based solar residences. This research underscores the need for carefully crafted approaches in navigating the complexities of modern grid dynamics amid the anticipated increase in electric vehicles.

Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) inference faces significant bottlenecks in preprocessing, which often dominate overall inference latency. We introduce AutoGNN, an FPGA-based accelerator designed to address these challenges by leveraging FPGA's reconfigurability and specialized components. AutoGNN adapts to diverse graph inputs, efficiently performing computationally intensive tasks such as graph conversion and sampling. By utilizing components like adder trees, AutoGNN executes reduction operations in constant time, overcoming the limitations of serialization and synchronization on GPUs.
  AutoGNN integrates unified processing elements (UPEs) and single-cycle reducers (SCRs) to streamline GNN preprocessing. UPEs enable scalable parallel processing for edge sorting and unique vertex selection, while SCRs efficiently handle sequential tasks such as pointer array construction and subgraph reindexing. A user-level software framework dynamically profiles graph inputs, determines optimal configurations, and reprograms AutoGNN to handle varying workloads. Implemented on a 7$n$m enterprise FPGA, AutoGNN achieves up to 9.0$\times$ and 2.1$\times$ speedup compared to conventional and GPU-accelerated preprocessing systems, respectively, enabling high-performance GNN preprocessing across diverse datasets.

Abstract: General matrix multiplication (GEMM) is a fundamental operation in deep learning (DL). With DL moving increasingly toward low precision, recent works have proposed novel unary GEMM designs as an alternative to conventional binary GEMM hardware. A rigorous evaluation of recent unary and binary GEMM designs is needed to assess the potential of unary hardware for future DL compute. This paper focuses on unary GEMM designs for integer-based DL inference and performs a detailed evaluation of three latest unary design proposals, namely, uGEMM, tuGEMM and tubGEMM, by comparing them to a conventional binary GEMM. Rigorous post-synthesis evaluations beyond prior works are performed across varying bit-widths and matrix sizes to assess the designs' tradeoffs and determine optimal sweetspots. Further, we perform weight sparsity analysis across eight pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the LLaMA2 large language model (LLM). In this work, we demonstrate how unary GEMM can be effectively used for energy-efficient compute in future edge AI accelerators.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have produced highly accurate but increasingly large and complex DNNs, making traditional fault-injection techniques impractical. Accurate fault analysis requires RTL-accurate hardware models. However, this significantly slows evaluation compared with software-only approaches, particularly when combined with expensive HDL instrumentation. In this work, we show that such high-overhead methods are unnecessary for systolic array (SA) architectures and propose ENFOR-SA, an end-to-end framework for DNN transient fault analysis on SAs. Our two-step approach employs cross-layer simulation and uses RTL SA components only during fault injection, with the rest executed at the software level. Experiments on CNNs and Vision Transformers demonstrate that ENFOR-SA achieves RTL-accurate fault injection with only 6% average slowdown compared to software-based injection, while delivering at least two orders of magnitude speedup (average $569\times$) over full-SoC RTL simulation and a $2.03\times$ improvement over a state-of-the-art cross-layer RTL injection tool. ENFOR-SA code is publicly available at https://github.com/rafaabt/ENFOR-SA.

Abstract: Leading experts from both communities have suggested the need to (re)connect research in neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the development of next-generation AI innovations. They term this convergence as NeuroAI. Previous research has established temporal neural networks (TNNs) as a promising neuromorphic approach toward biological intelligence and efficiency. We fully embrace NeuroAI and propose a new category of TNNs we call NeuroAI TNNs (NeuTNNs) with greater capability and hardware efficiency by adopting neuroscience findings, including a neuron model with active dendrites and a hierarchy of distal and proximal segments. This work introduces a PyTorch-to-layout tool suite (NeuTNNGen) to design application-specific NeuTNNs. Compared to previous TNN designs, NeuTNNs achieve superior performance and efficiency. We demonstrate NeuTNNGen's capabilities using three example applications: 1) UCR time series benchmarks, 2) MNIST design exploration, and 3) Place Cells design for neocortical reference frames. We also explore using synaptic pruning to further reduce synapse counts and hardware costs by 30-50% while maintaining model precision across diverse sensory modalities. NeuTNNGen can facilitate the design of application-specific energy-efficient NeuTNNs for the next generation of NeuroAI computing systems.

Abstract: Expanding Deep Learning applications toward edge computing demands architectures capable of delivering high computational performance and efficiency while adhering to tight power and memory constraints. Digital In-Memory Computing (DIMC) addresses this need by moving part of the computation directly within memory arrays, significantly reducing data movement and improving energy efficiency. This paper introduces a novel architecture that extends the Vector RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to integrate a tightly coupled DIMC unit directly into the execution stage of the pipeline, to accelerate Deep Learning inference at the edge. Specifically, the proposed approach adds four custom instructions dedicated to data loading, computation, and write-back, enabling flexible and optimal control of the inference execution on the target architecture. Experimental results demonstrate high utilization of the DIMC tile in Vector RISC-V and sustained throughput across the ResNet-50 model, achieving a peak performance of 137 GOP/s. The proposed architecture achieves a speedup of 217x over the baseline core and 50x area-normalized speedup even when operating near the hardware resource limits. The experimental results confirm the high potential of the proposed architecture as a scalable and efficient solution to accelerate Deep Learning inference on the edge.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Domain-specialized FPGAs have delivered unprecedented performance for low-latency inference across scientific and industrial workloads, yet nearly all existing accelerators assume static models trained offline, relegating learning and adaptation to slower CPUs or GPUs. This separation fundamentally limits systems that must operate in non-stationary, high-frequency environments, where model updates must occur at the timescale of the underlying physics. In this paper, I argue for a shift from inference-only accelerators to ultrafast on-chip learning, in which both inference and training execute directly within the FPGA fabric under deterministic, sub-microsecond latency constraints. Bringing learning into the same real-time datapath as inference would enable closed-loop systems that adapt as fast as the physical processes they control, with applications spanning quantum error correction, cryogenic qubit calibration, plasma and fusion control, accelerator tuning, and autonomous scientific experiments. Enabling such regimes requires rethinking algorithms, architectures, and toolflows jointly, but promises to transform FPGAs from static inference engines into real-time learning machines.

Abstract: Ultrafast online learning is essential for high-frequency systems, such as controls for quantum computing and nuclear fusion, where adaptation must occur on sub-microsecond timescales. Meeting these requirements demands low-latency, fixed-precision computation under strict memory constraints, a regime in which conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are both inefficient and numerically unstable. We identify key properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that align with these constraints. Specifically, we show that: (i) KAN updates exploiting B-spline locality are sparse, enabling superior on-chip resource scaling, and (ii) KANs are inherently robust to fixed-point quantization. By implementing fixed-point online training on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), a representative platform for on-chip computation, we demonstrate that KAN-based online learners are significantly more efficient and expressive than MLPs across a range of low-latency and resource-constrained tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate model-free online learning at sub-microsecond latencies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code generation, but their adherence to fine-grained user intent with multiple constraints remains a significant challenge. Our empirical analysis reveals two key observations: 1) Model performance deteriorates quickly as the number of constraints in the user intent increases, and 2) While user intent does influence the model's logits, such an influence may not be strong enough to effectively steer the decoding process. To this end, we propose Intent-Amplified Code Generation (IntentCoding), a novel decoding strategy that enhances an LLM's ability to follow user intent. IntentCoding captures the influence of user intent by masking out the intent, and applies a multi-strength ensemble mechanism to amplify the effect of user intent during generation. IntentCoding is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and integrates seamlessly with existing decoding procedures. To enable systematic evaluation, we also construct CodeConstraints, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to test user intent compliance under varying numbers of constraints. Experiments on our constructed Constraints, as well as popular IFEvalCode, HumanEval and LiveCodeBench datasets, show that our IntentCoding model significantly improves both constraint satisfaction and functional correctness compared to standard decoding approaches. IntentCoding achieves up to 71.0% relative improvement on CodeConstraints, achieves up to 67.3% relative improvement on IFEvalCode and achieves up to 29.3% relative improvement in pass@1 on HumanEval and LiveCodeBench compared with greedy decoding.

Abstract: Autonomous coding agents (e.g., OpenAI Codex, Devin, GitHub Copilot) are increasingly used to generate fix-related pull requests (PRs) in real world software repositories. However, their practical effectiveness depends on whether these contributions are accepted and merged by project maintainers. In this paper, we present an empirical study of AI agent involved fix related PRs, examining both their integration outcomes, latency, and the factors that hinder successful merging. We first analyze 8,106 fix related PRs authored by five widely used AI coding agents from the AIDEV POP dataset to quantify the proportions of PRs that are merged, closed without merging, or remain open. We then conduct a manual qualitative analysis of a statistically significant sample of 326 closed but unmerged PRs, spending approximately 100 person hours to construct a structured catalog of 12 failure reasons. Our results indicate that test case failures and prior resolution of the same issues by other PRs are the most common causes of non integration, whereas build or deployment failures are comparatively rare. Overall, our findings expose key limitations of current AI coding agents in real world settings and highlight directions for their further improvement and for more effective human AI collaboration in software maintenance.

Abstract: The rise of AI coding assistants has reignited interest in an old idea: what if specifications-not code-were the primary artifact of software development? Spec-driven development (SDD) inverts the traditional workflow by treating specifications as the source of truth and code as a generated or verified secondary artifact. This paper provides practitioners with a comprehensive guide to SDD, covering its principles, workflow patterns, and supporting tools. We present three levels of specification rigor-spec-first, spec-anchored, and spec-as-source-with clear guidance on when each applies. Through analysis of tools ranging from Behavior-Driven Development frameworks to modern AI-assisted toolkits like GitHub Spec Kit, we demonstrate how the spec-first philosophy maps to real implementations. We present case studies from API development, enterprise systems, and embedded software, illustrating how different domains apply SDD. We conclude with a decision framework helping practitioners determine when SDD provides value and when simpler approaches suffice.

Abstract: Polyglot programming is gaining popularity as developers integrate multiple programming languages to harness their individual strengths. With the recent popularity of platforms like GraalVM and other multi-language runtimes, creating and managing these systems has become much more feasible. However, current research on analyzing multilingual programs mainly focuses on two languages, leaving out the increasing complexity of systems that use three or more. For example, modern web systems often link JavaScript, WebAssembly, and Rust within the same execution chain. This paper envisions the landscape of software systems with three-language polyglot communication. We identify fundamental challenges in analyzing them and propose a conceptual roadmap to advance static analysis techniques to address them. Our vision aims to stimulate discussion and inspire new research directions toward scalable, language-agnostic analysis frameworks for next-generation polyglot systems.

Abstract: Coding agents have received significant adoption in software development recently. Unlike traditional LLM-based code completion tools, coding agents work with autonomy (e.g., invoking external tools) and leave visible traces in software repositories, such as authoring commits. Among their tasks, coding agents may autonomously generate software tests; however, the quality of these tests remains uncertain. In particular, excessive use of mocking can make tests harder to understand and maintain. This paper presents the first study to investigate the presence of mocks in agent-generated tests of real-world software systems. We analyzed over 1.2 million commits made in 2025 in 2,168 TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python repositories, including 48,563 commits by coding agents, 169,361 commits that modify tests, and 44,900 commits that add mocks to tests. Overall, we find that coding agents are more likely to modify tests and to add mocks to tests than non-coding agents. We detect that (1) 60% of the repositories with agent activity also contain agent test activity; (2) 23% of commits made by coding agents add/change test files, compared with 13% by non-agents; (3) 68% of the repositories with agent test activity also contain agent mock activity; (4) 36% of commits made by coding agents add mocks to tests, compared with 26% by non-agents; and (5) repositories created recently contain a higher proportion of test and mock commits made by agents. Finally, we conclude by discussing implications for developers and researchers. We call attention to the fact that tests with mocks may be potentially easier to generate automatically (but less effective at validating real interactions), and the need to include guidance on mocking practices in agent configuration files.

Abstract: Analyzing the code evolution of software systems is relevant for practitioners, researchers, and educators. It can help practitioners identify design trends and maintenance challenges, provide researchers with empirical data to study changes over time, and give educators real-world examples that enhance the teaching of software evolution concepts. Unfortunately, we lack tools specifically designed to support code evolution analysis. In this paper, we propose GitEvo, a multi-language and extensible tool for analyzing code evolution in Git repositories. GitEvo leverages Git frameworks and code parsing tools to integrate both Git-level and code-level analysis. We conclude by describing how GitEvo can support the development of novel empirical studies on code evolution and act as a learning tool for educators and students. GitEvo is available at: https://github.com/andrehora/gitevo.

Abstract: Formal specifications play a pivotal role in accurately characterizing program behaviors and ensuring software correctness. In recent years, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for the automatic generation of program specifications has emerged as a promising avenue for enhancing verification efficiency. However, existing research has been predominantly confined to generating specifications based on basic syntactic constructs, falling short of meeting the demands for high-level abstraction in complex program verification. Consequently, we propose incorporating logical constructs into existing LLM-based specification generation framework. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of systematic investigation into whether LLMs can effectively generate such complex constructs. To this end, we conduct an empirical study aimed at exploring the impact of various types of syntactic constructs on specification generation framework. Specifically, we define four syntactic configurations with varying levels of abstraction and perform extensive evaluations on mainstream program verification datasets, employing a diverse set of representative LLMs. Experimental results first confirm that LLMs are capable of generating valid logical constructs. Further analysis reveals that the synergistic use of logical constructs and basic syntactic constructs leads to improvements in both verification capability and robustness, without significantly increasing verification overhead. Additionally, we uncover the distinct advantages of two refinement paradigms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic work exploring the feasibility of utilizing LLMs for generating high-level logical constructs, providing an empirical basis and guidance for the future construction of automated program verification framework with enhanced abstraction capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with long-context code due to window limitations. Existing textual code compression methods mitigate this via selective filtering but often disrupt dependency closure, causing semantic fragmentation. To address this, we introduce LongCodeOCR, a visual compression framework that renders code into compressed two-dimensional image sequences for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By preserving a global view, this approach avoids the dependency breakage inherent in filtering. We systematically evaluate LongCodeOCR against the state-of-the-art LongCodeZip across four benchmarks spanning code summarization, code question answering, and code completion.
  Our results demonstrate that visual code compression serves as a viable alternative for tasks requiring global understanding. At comparable compression ratios ($\sim$1.7$\times$), LongCodeOCR improves CompScore on Long Module Summarization by 36.85 points over LongCodeZip. At a 1M-token context length with Glyph (a specialized 9B VLM), LongCodeOCR maintains higher accuracy than LongCodeZip while operating at about 4$\times$ higher compression. Moreover, compared with LongCodeZip, LongCodeOCR drastically reduces compression-stage overhead (reducing latency from $\sim$4.3 hours to $\sim$1 minute at 1M tokens). Finally, our results characterize a fundamental coverage--fidelity trade-off: visual code compression retains broader context coverage to support global dependencies, yet faces fidelity bottlenecks on exactness-critical tasks; by contrast, textual code compression preserves symbol-level precision while sacrificing structural coverage.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLMs have achieved strong performance on text-based programming tasks, yet they remain unreliable for block-based languages such as Scratch. Scratch programs exhibit deeply nested, non-linear structures, event-driven concurrency across multiple sprites, and tight coupling between code and multimedia assets, properties that differ fundamentally from textual code. As a result, LLMs often misinterpret Scratch semantics and generate large, invasive edits that are syntactically valid but semantically incorrect when repairing buggy programs.
  We introduce ScratchEval, the first executable benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair for Scratch programs, covering program understanding, debugging, analysis, and repair. The benchmark contains 100 curated Scratch projects from the public repository, selected for structural and semantic complexity. Each project is paired with executable test suites, bug descriptions with corresponding fixes, block-level edit constraints defining minimal semantically correct repairs, and required multimedia assets. The benchmark is constructed through a human-in-the-loop pipeline combining automated project mining with expert validation of trigger-outcome semantics and representative bug patterns, with emphasis on event ordering, concurrency, and state management.
  To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we propose a three-layer executable protocol measuring functional correctness via VM-level execution, repair quality using block-level edit distance and behavioral trajectory comparisons, and explanation quality via structured rubrics assessing alignment between model reasoning and generated patches. Using ScratchEval, we study domain-specific fine-tuning, training data effectiveness, and model generalization to unseen bug types. ScratchEval provides a reproducible foundation for evaluating and post-training LLMs on block-based programming tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Best testing practices state that tests should verify a single functionality or behavior of the system. Tests that verify multiple behaviors are harder to understand, lack focus, and are more coupled to the production code. An attempt to identify this issue is the test smell \emph{Eager Test}, which aims to capture tests that verify too much functionality based on the number of production method calls. Unfortunately, prior research suggests that counting production method calls is an inaccurate measure, as these calls do not reliably serve as a proxy for functionality. We envision a complementary solution based on runtime analysis: we hypothesize that some tests that verify multiple behaviors will likely cover multiple paths of the same production methods. Thus, we propose a novel test smell named \emph{Test Obsessed by Method}, a test method that covers multiple paths of a single production method. We provide an initial empirical study to explore the presence of this smell in 2,054 tests provided by 12 test suites of the Python Standard Library. (1) We detect 44 \emph{Tests Obsessed by Methods} in 11 of the 12 test suites. (2) Each smelly test verifies a median of two behaviors of the production method. (3) The 44 smelly tests could be split into 118 novel tests. (4) 23% of the smelly tests have code comments recognizing that distinct behaviors are being tested. We conclude by discussing benefits, limitations, and further research.

Abstract: C/C++ is a prevalent programming language. Yet, it suffers from significant memory and thread-safety issues. Recent studies have explored automated translation of C/C++ to safer languages, such as Rust. However, these studies focused mostly on the correctness and safety of the translated code, which are indeed critical, but they left other important quality concerns (e.g., performance, robustness, and maintainability) largely unexplored. This work investigates strengths and weaknesses of three C-to-Rust translators, namely C2Rust (a transpiler), C2SaferRust (an LLM-guided transpiler), and TranslationGym (an LLM-based direct translation). We perform an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of several important quality attributes for the translated Rust code of the popular GNU coreutils, using human-based translation as a baseline. To assess the internal and external quality of the Rust code, we: (i) apply Clippy, a rule-based state-of-the-practice Rust static analysis tool; (ii) investigate the capability of an LLM (GPT-4o) to identify issues potentially overlooked by Clippy; and (iii) perform a manual analysis of the issues reported by Clippy and GPT-4o. Our results show that while newer techniques reduce some unsafe and non-idiomatic patterns, they frequently introduce new issues, revealing systematic trade-offs that are not visible under existing evaluation practices. Notably, none of the automated techniques consistently match or exceed human-written translations across all quality dimensions, yet even human-written Rust code exhibits persistent internal quality issues such as readability and non-idiomatic patterns. Together, these findings show that translation quality remains a multi-dimensional challenge, requiring systematic evaluation and targeted tool support beyond both naive automation and manual rewriting.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly becoming the standard interface for Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover and invoke external tools. However, existing evaluations often fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios, relying on restricted toolsets, simplistic workflows, or subjective LLM-as-a-judge metrics. We introduce MCP-Atlas, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating tool-use competency, comprising 36 real MCP servers and 220 tools. It includes 1,000 tasks designed to assess tool-use competency in realistic, multi-step workflows. Tasks use natural language prompts that avoid naming specific tools or servers, requiring agents to identify and orchestrate 3-6 tool calls across multiple servers. We score tasks using a claims-based rubric that awards partial credit based on the factual claims satisfied in the model's final answer, complemented by internal diagnostics on tool discovery, parameterization, syntax, error recovery, and efficiency. Evaluation results on frontier models reveal that top models achieve pass rates exceeding 50%, with primary failures arising from inadequate tool usage and task understanding. We release the task schema, containerized harness, and a 500-task public subset of the benchmark dataset to facilitate reproducible comparisons and advance the development of robust, tool-augmented agents.

Abstract: The distributed nature of microservice architecture introduces significant resilience challenges. Traditional testing methods, limited by extensive manual effort and oversimplified test environments, fail to capture production system complexity. To address these limitations, we present Cast, an automated, end-to-end framework for microservice resilience testing in production. It achieves high test fidelity by replaying production traffic against a comprehensive library of application-level faults to exercise internal error-handling logic. To manage the combinatorial test space, Cast employs a complexity-driven strategy to systematically prune redundant tests and prioritize high-value tests targeting the most critical service execution paths. Cast automates the testing lifecycle through a three-phase pipeline (i.e., startup, fault injection, and recovery) and uses a multi-faceted oracle to automatically verify system resilience against nuanced criteria. Deployed in Huawei Cloud for over eight months, Cast has been adopted by many service teams to proactively address resilience vulnerabilities. Our analysis on four large-scale applications with millions of traces reveals 137 potential vulnerabilities, with 89 confirmed by developers. To further quantify its performance, Cast is evaluated on a benchmark set of 48 reproduced bugs, achieving a high coverage of 90%. The results show that Cast is a practical and effective solution for systematically improving the reliability of industrial microservice systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern microservice systems exhibit continuous structural evolution in their runtime call graphs due to workload fluctuations, fault responses, and deployment activities. Despite this complexity, our analysis of over 500,000 production traces from ByteDance reveals a latent regularity: execution paths concentrate around a small set of recurring invocation patterns. However, existing resource management approaches fail to exploit this structure. Industrial autoscalers like Kubernetes HPA ignore inter-service dependencies, while recent academic methods often assume static topologies, rendering them ineffective under dynamic execution contexts. In this work, we propose Morphis, a dependency-aware provisioning framework that unifies pattern-aware trace analysis with global optimization. It introduces structural fingerprinting that decomposes traces into a stable execution backbone and interpretable deviation subgraphs. Then, resource allocation is formulated as a constrained optimization problem over predicted pattern distributions, jointly minimizing aggregate CPU usage while satisfying end-to-end tail-latency SLOs. Our extensive evaluations on the TrainTicket benchmark demonstrate that Morphis reduces CPU consumption by 35-38% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining 98.8% SLO compliance.

Abstract: Library migration is a common but error-prone task in software development. Developers may need to replace one library with another due to reasons like changing requirements or licensing changes. Migration typically entails updating and rewriting source code manually. While automated migration tools exist, most rely on mining examples from real-world projects that have already undergone similar migrations. However, these data are scarce, and collecting them for arbitrary pairs of libraries is difficult. Moreover, these migration tools often miss out on leveraging modern code transformation infrastructure.
  In this paper, we present a new approach to automated API migration that sidesteps the limitations described above. Instead of relying on existing migration data or using LLMs directly for transformation, we use LLMs to extract migration examples. Next, we use an Agent to generalize those examples to reusable transformation scripts in PolyglotPiranha, a modern code transformation tool. Our method distills latent migration knowledge from LLMs into structured, testable, and repeatable migration logic, without requiring preexisting corpora or manual engineering effort. Experimental results across Python libraries show that our system can generate diverse migration examples and synthesize transformation scripts that generalize to real-world codebases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based code generation is predominantly formulated as a strictly monotonic process, appending tokens linearly to an immutable prefix. This formulation contrasts to the cognitive process of programming, which is inherently interleaved with forward generation and on-the-fly revision. While prior works attempt to introduce revision via post-hoc agents or external static tools, they either suffer from high latency or fail to leverage the model's intrinsic semantic reasoning. In this paper, we propose Stream of Revision, a paradigm shift that elevates code generation from a monotonic stream to a dynamic, self-correcting trajectory by leveraging model's intrinsic capabilities. We introduce specific action tokens that enable the model to seamlessly backtrack and edit its own history within a single forward pass. By internalizing the revision loop, our framework Stream of Revision allows the model to activate its latent capabilities just-in-time without external dependencies. Empirical results on secure code generation show that Stream of Revision significantly reduces vulnerabilities with minimal inference overhead.

Abstract: Requirements traceability, the process of establishing and maintaining relationships between requirements and various software development artifacts, is paramount for ensuring system integrity and fulfilling requirements throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Traditional methods, including manual and information retrieval models, are labor-intensive, error-prone, and limited by low precision. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for supporting software engineering tasks through advanced language comprehension. However, a substantial gap exists in the systematic design and evaluation of prompts tailored to extract accurate trace links. This paper introduces TraceLLM, a systematic framework for enhancing requirements traceability through prompt engineering and demonstration selection. Our approach incorporates rigorous dataset splitting, iterative prompt refinement, enrichment with contextual roles and domain knowledge, and evaluation across zero- and few-shot settings. We assess prompt generalization and robustness using eight state-of-the-art LLMs on four benchmark datasets representing diverse domains (aerospace, healthcare) and artifact types (requirements, design elements, test cases, regulations). TraceLLM achieves state-of-the-art F2 scores, outperforming traditional IR baselines, fine-tuned models, and prior LLM-based methods. We also explore the impact of demonstration selection strategies, identifying label-aware, diversity-based sampling as particularly effective. Overall, our findings highlight that traceability performance depends not only on model capacity but also critically on the quality of prompt engineering. In addition, the achieved performance suggests that TraceLLM can support semi-automated traceability workflows in which candidate links are reviewed and validated by human analysts.

Abstract: Workflow automation has become increasingly accessible through low-code platforms, enabling small organizations and individuals to improve operational efficiency without extensive software development expertise. This study evaluates the performance impact of workflow automation using n8n through a small-scale business case study. A representative lead-processing workflow was implemented to automatically store data, send email confirmations, and generate real-time notifications. Experimental benchmarking was conducted by comparing 20 manual executions with 25 automated executions under controlled conditions. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in the average execution time from 185.35 seconds (manual) to 1.23 seconds (automated), corresponding to an approximately 151 times reduction in execution time. Additionally, manual execution exhibited an error rate of 5%, while automated execution achieved zero observed errors. The findings highlight the effectiveness of low-code automation in improving efficiency, reliability, and operational consistency for small-scale workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in Natural Language Understanding and Generation, but deploying them directly in online advertising systems is often impractical due to strict millisecond-level latency constraints. This has motivated the use of LLMs offline to improve retrieval, ranking, and recommendation models. Existing solutions typically fine-tune separate LLMs for individual tasks such as query-ad relevance labeling, keyword-based query generation, and user profiling. This results in redundant models, high maintenance cost, and limited performance gains despite substantial overlap in domain knowledge and reasoning patterns. We introduce AdNanny, a unified reasoning-centric LLM that serves as a shared backbone for offline advertising tasks. AdNanny is obtained by fine-tuning a public 671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1 checkpoint using a scalable training system that supports hybrid dense-MoE parallelism. We construct reasoning-augmented corpora that pair structured supervision with step-by-step natural language explanations. A multi-task supervised fine-tuning stage with adaptive reweighting enables AdNanny to handle diverse labeling and generation tasks in a consistent reasoning format. This is followed by reinforcement learning using downstream advertising metrics to align model behavior with online retrieval and ranking objectives. AdNanny is deployed in production within Bing Ads, where it significantly reduces manual labeling effort and improves accuracy across multiple offline tasks. By consolidating many task-specific models into a single reasoning-centric foundation model, AdNanny provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale advertising systems.

Abstract: Mobile apps face strong pressure for fast and reliable updates. Continuous Integration (CI) helps automate builds, tests, and releases, but its impact on mobile development remains underexplored. Despite the widespread use of CI, little is known about how it affects development activity, release speed, and user-facing outcomes in mobile projects. Existing studies mostly focus on CI adoption in general-purpose software, providing limited insight into mobile-specific dynamics, such as app store visibility and user engagement. In this paper, we analyze open-source Android apps to (1) compare CI adopters and non-adopters, (2) characterize adoption patterns using activity and bug metrics, and (3) assess pre/post adoption changes and user-facing outcomes. We observe that CI adopters are larger and more active, with faster and more regular releases. CI adoption is concentrated in integration- and reliability-intensive categories (e.g., finance and productivity) and is associated with higher Google Play Store engagement (more downloads and reviews) without lower ratings. Overall, CI adoption aligns with practices that support sustained delivery, higher project visibility, and stronger user engagement in mobile ecosystems.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success that Multi-Agent Code Generation Systems (MACGS) have achieved, the inherent complexity of multi-agent architectures produces substantial volumes of intermediate outputs. To date, the individual importance of these intermediate outputs to the system correctness remains opaque, which impedes targeted optimization of MACGS designs. To address this challenge, we propose CAM, the first \textbf{C}ausality-based \textbf{A}nalysis framework for \textbf{M}ACGS that systematically quantifies the contribution of different intermediate features for system correctness. By comprehensively categorizing intermediate outputs and systematically simulating realistic errors on intermediate features, we identify the important features for system correctness and aggregate their importance rankings.
  We conduct extensive empirical analysis on the identified importance rankings. Our analysis reveals intriguing findings: first, we uncover context-dependent features\textemdash features whose importance emerges mainly through interactions with other features, revealing that quality assurance for MACGS should incorporate cross-feature consistency checks; second, we reveal that hybrid backend MACGS with different backend LLMs assigned according to their relative strength achieves up to 7.2\% Pass@1 improvement, underscoring hybrid architectures as a promising direction for future MACGS design. We further demonstrate CAM's practical utility through two applications: (1) failure repair which achieves a 73.3\% success rate by optimizing top-3 importance-ranked features and (2) feature pruning that reduces up to 66.8\% intermediate token consumption while maintaining generation performance. Our work provides actionable insights for MACGS design and deployment, establishing causality analysis as a powerful approach for understanding and improving MACGS.

Abstract: Artifact evaluation has been adopted in the Software Engineering (SE) research community for 15 years, substantially improving research reproducibility across major SE conferences. However, this success has introduced a growing scalability challenge, as artifact evaluation relies heavily on reviewers' manual execution and debugging, leading to escalating human effort amid rapidly increasing paper submissions. To address this problem, we investigate automated artifact evaluation. We first conduct a preliminary study on artifacts from top-tier SE conferences and identify three key challenges: perceiving execution states, maintaining stable execution environments, and recovering from execution errors. Inspired by these findings, we propose ArtifactCopilot, the first end-to-end agent-based framework for automated artifact evaluation. ArtifactCopilot automates environment construction, instruction execution, and error recovery by combining an execution normalization strategy to ensure environment stability with an artifact evaluation graph that transforms README documents into dependency-aware command graphs, enabling structured execution planning, execution-state tracking, and error recovery. Evaluation on 48 real-world artifacts shows that ArtifactCopilot matches human artifact evaluation outcomes for 85.42% of the artifacts, outperforming Claude Code by 52.09 percentage points, while costing only \$0.091 per artifact on average and requiring zero human intervention for 45 out of 48 artifacts.

Abstract: LLM-powered coding agents are redefining how real-world software is developed. To drive the research towards better coding agents, we require challenging benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate the ability of such agents to perform various software engineering tasks. However, popular coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and SWE-Bench focus on narrowly scoped tasks such as competition programming and patch generation. In reality, software engineers have to handle a broader set of tasks for real-world software development. To address this gap, we propose OmniCode, a novel software engineering benchmark that contains a broader and more diverse set of task categories beyond code or patch generation. Overall, OmniCode contains 1794 tasks spanning three programming languages (Python, Java, and C++) and four key categories: bug fixing, test generation, code review fixing, and style fixing. In contrast to prior software engineering benchmarks, the tasks in OmniCode are (1) manually validated to eliminate ill-defined problems, and (2) synthetically crafted or recently curated to avoid data leakage issues, presenting a new framework for synthetically generating diverse software tasks from limited real-world data. We evaluate OmniCode with popular agent frameworks such as SWE-Agent and show that while they may perform well on bug fixing for Python, they fall short on tasks such as Test Generation and in languages such as C++ and Java. For instance, SWE-Agent achieves a maximum of 20.9% with DeepSeek-V3.1 on Java Test Generation tasks. OmniCode aims to serve as a robust benchmark and spur the development of agents that can perform well across different aspects of software development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs have led to significant breakthroughs in various AI applications. However, their sophisticated capabilities also introduce severe safety concerns, particularly the generation of harmful content through jailbreak attacks. Current safety testing for LLMs often relies on static datasets and lacks systematic criteria to evaluate the quality and adequacy of these tests. While coverage criteria have been effective for smaller neural networks, they are not directly applicable to LLMs due to scalability issues and differing objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RACA, a novel set of coverage criteria specifically designed for LLM safety testing. RACA leverages representation engineering to focus on safety-critical concepts within LLMs, thereby reducing dimensionality and filtering out irrelevant information. The framework operates in three stages: first, it identifies safety-critical representations using a small, expert-curated calibration set of jailbreak prompts. Second, it calculates conceptual activation scores for a given test suite based on these representations. Finally, it computes coverage results using six sub-criteria that assess both individual and compositional safety concepts. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate RACA's effectiveness, applicability, and generalization, where the results demonstrate that RACA successfully identifies high-quality jailbreak prompts and is superior to traditional neuron-level criteria. We also showcase its practical application in real-world scenarios, such as test set prioritization and attack prompt sampling. Furthermore, our findings confirm RACA's generalization to various scenarios and its robustness across various configurations. Overall, RACA provides a new framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs, contributing a valuable technique to the field of testing for AI.

Abstract: Robotic systems are complex and safety-critical software systems. As such, they need to be tested thoroughly. Unfortunately, robot software is intrinsically hard to test compared to traditional software, mainly since the software needs to closely interact with hardware, account for uncertainty in its operational environment, handle disturbances, and act highly autonomously. However, given the large space in which robots operate, anticipating possible failures when designing tests is challenging. This paper presents a mapping study by considering robotics testing papers and relating them to the software testing theory. We consider 247 robotics testing papers and map them to software testing, discussing the state-of-the-art software testing in robotics with an illustrated example, and discuss current challenges. Forming the basis to introduce both the robotics and software engineering communities to software testing challenges. Finally, we identify open questions and lessons learned.

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) is widely used to provide rapid feedback on code changes; however, CI build outcomes are not always reliable. Builds may fail intermittently due to non-deterministic factors, leading to flaky builds that undermine developers' trust in CI, waste computational resources, and threaten the validity of CI-related empirical studies. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of flaky builds in GitHub Actions based on rerun data from 1,960 open-source Java projects. Our results show that 3.2% of builds are rerun, and 67.73% of these rerun builds exhibit flaky behavior, affecting 1,055 (51.28%) of the projects. Through an in-depth failure analysis, we identify 15 distinct categories of flaky failures, among which flaky tests, network issues, and dependency resolution issues are the most prevalent. Building on these findings, we propose a machine learning-based approach for detecting flaky failures at the job level. Compared with a state-of-the-art baseline, our approach improves the F1-score by up to 20.3%.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comparative study of five autonomous coding agents using AIDev-pop, which is a public dataset containing thousands of AI-generated pull requests (PRs) across popular open-source repositories. We evaluate agents' performance along three task-aware dimensions spanning the PR lifecycle: (1) PR acceptance rate, (2) review discussion volume, and (3) commit message quality. Our quantitative analysis finds that Codex consistently achieves high PR acceptance rates across most task categories, while Copilot's PRs trigger the highest volume of both human and automated review discussions. In contrast, commit-level quality varies independently of acceptance outcomes. Claude and Cursor produce higher proportions of high-quality commit messages across several task types, and Codex exhibiting comparatively lower commit quality despite strong integration outcomes. Our findings inform selection and improvements of AI agents for their effective integration to collaborative software engineering.

Abstract: We propose SWE-Universe, a scalable and efficient framework for automatically constructing real-world software engineering (SWE) verifiable environments from GitHub pull requests (PRs). To overcome the prevalent challenges of automatic building, such as low production yield, weak verifiers, and prohibitive cost, our framework utilizes a building agent powered by an efficient custom-trained model. This agent employs iterative self-verification and in-loop hacking detection to ensure the reliable generation of high-fidelity, verifiable tasks. Using this method, we scale the number of real-world multilingual SWE environments to a million scale (807,693). We demonstrate the profound value of our environments through large-scale agentic mid-training and reinforcement learning. Finally, we applied this technique to Qwen3-Max-Thinking and achieved a score of 75.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Our work provides both a critical resource and a robust methodology to advance the next generation of coding agents.

Abstract: Networks in the current 5G and beyond systems increasingly carry heterogeneous traffic with diverse quality-of-service constraints, making real-time routing decisions both complex and time-critical. A common approach, such as a heuristic with human intervention or training a single centralized RL policy or synchronizing updates across multiple learners, struggles with scalability and straggler effects. We address this by proposing an asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMARL) framework in which independent PPO agents, one per service, plan routes in parallel and commit resource deltas to a shared global resource environment. This coordination by state preserves feasibility across services and enables specialization for service-specific objectives. We evaluate the method on an O-RAN like network simulation using nearly real-time traffic data from the city of Montreal. We compared against a single-agent PPO baseline. AMARL achieves a similar Grade of Service (acceptance rate) (GoS) and end-to-end latency, with reduced training wall-clock time and improved robustness to demand shifts. These results suggest that asynchronous, service-specialized agents provide a scalable and practical approach to distributed routing, with applicability extending beyond the O-RAN domain.

Abstract: As wireless communication networks grow in scale and complexity, diverse resource allocation tasks become increasingly critical. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a promising solution for distributed control, yet it often requires costly real-world interactions and lacks generalization across diverse tasks. Meanwhile, recent advances in Diffusion Models (DMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling complex dynamics and supporting high-fidelity simulation. Motivated by these challenges and opportunities, we propose a Communication-based Diffusion World Model (NetWorld) to enable few-shot generalization across heterogeneous MARL tasks in wireless networks. To improve applicability to large-scale distributed networks, NetWorld adopts the Distributed Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm and is organized into a two-stage framework: (i) pre-training a classifier-guided conditional diffusion world model on multi-task offline datasets, and (ii) performing trajectory planning entirely within this world model to avoid additional online interaction. Cross-task heterogeneity is handled via shared latent processing for observations, two-hot discretization for task-specific actions and rewards, and an inverse dynamics model for action recovery. We further introduce a lightweight Mean Field (MF) communication mechanism to reduce non-stationarity and promote coordinated behaviors with low overhead. Experiments on three representative tasks demonstrate improved performance and sample efficiency over MARL baselines, indicating strong scalability and practical potential for wireless network optimization.

Abstract: The Internet has evolved through successive architectural abstractions that enabled unprecedented scale, interoperability, and innovation. Packet-based networking enabled the reliable transport of bits; cloud-native systems enabled the orchestration of distributed computation. Today, the emergence of autonomous, learning-based systems introduces a new architectural challenge: intelligence is increasingly embedded directly into network control, computation, and decision-making, yet the Internet lacks a structural foundation for representing and exchanging meaning. In this paper, we argue that cognition alone: pattern recognition, prediction, and optimization, is insufficient for the next generation of networked systems. As autonomous agents act across safety-critical and socio-technical domains, systems must not only compute and communicate, but also comprehend intent, context, and consequence. We introduce the concept of a Semantic Layer: a new architectural stratum that treats meaning as a first-class construct, enabling interpretive alignment, semantic accountability, and intelligible autonomous behavior. We show that this evolution leads naturally to a Syntactic-Semantic Internet. The syntactic stack continues to transport bits, packets, and workloads with speed and reliability, while a parallel semantic stack transports meaning, grounding, and consequence. We describe the structure of this semantic stack-semantic communication, a semantic substrate, and an emerging Agentic Web, and draw explicit architectural parallels to TCP/IP and the World Wide Web. Finally, we examine current industry efforts, identify critical architectural gaps, and outline the engineering challenges required to make semantic interoperability a global, interoperable infrastructure.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of modern wide-area networks (WANs) has made traffic engineering (TE) increasingly challenging, as traditional solvers struggle to keep pace. Although existing offline ML-driven approaches accelerate TE optimization with deep neural networks (DNNs), they often lack sufficient expressiveness and generalization on unseen traffic patterns or topologies, limiting their practicality. Inspired by the success of large language models (LMs), for the first time, this paper investigates their potential as general-purpose traffic planners. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) Theoretically, we show that pre-trained LMs can simulate the sequential decision processes underlying TE and, crucially, exhibit parallel reasoning capabilities, making them well-suited for the task; (ii) Practically, we present LMTE, a novel LM-driven TE framework that embraces these insights through efficient multimodal alignment and lightweight configuration generation, all while preserving the model's original abilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fold matches top-tier performance on five datasets, achieving up to 15\% better maximum link utilization (MLU) and consistently lower performance degradation across diverse scenarios, e.g., less than 5\% with high traffic dynamics and link failures. Moreover, it achieves 10 to 100 times speedups over traditional TE solvers. To aid future works, our codebase is available at https://github.com/Y-debug-sys/LMTE.

Abstract: Ensuring network resilience in 6G and beyond is essential to maintain service continuity during base station (BS) outages due to failures, disasters, attacks, or energy-saving operations. This paper proposes a novel resilience optimization framework for integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs), leveraging low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to assist users when terrestrial BSs are unavailable. Specifically, we develop a realistic multi-cell model incorporating user association, antenna downtilt adaptation, power control, heterogeneous traffic demands, and dynamic user distribution. The objective is to maximize of the total user rate in the considered area by optimizing the BS's antenna tilt, transmission power, user association to neighboring BS or to a LEO satellite with a minimum number of successfully served user satisfaction constraint, defined by rate and Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) requirements. To solve the non-convex, NP-hard problem, we design a deep Q-network (DQN)-based algorithm to learn network dynamics to maximize throughput while minimizing LEO satellite usage, thereby limiting reliance on links with longer propagation delays and prolonging satellite operational lifetime. Simulation results confirm that our approach significantly outperforms the benchmark one.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimedia applications in smart city environments and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) presents significant challenges for existing network infrastructures, particularly with the advent of 5G and emerging 6G technologies. Traditional architectures struggle to meet the demands for scalability, adaptability, and energy efficiency required by data-intensive multimedia services. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative, energy-efficient framework for multimedia resource management in software-defined 5G/6G IoV networks, leveraging a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. The framework integrates Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) technologies to enable centralized and adaptive control over network resources. By employing a PID controller, it dynamically manages load distribution and temperature, ensuring balanced resource allocation and minimizing energy waste. Comprehensive simulations validate the framework's effectiveness, demonstrating significant improvements in load balancing, CPU utilization, and energy consumption compared to traditional methods. For instance, under heavy traffic conditions, the proposed framework maintained resource efficiency, reducing power consumption by up to 30% and achieving nearly equal load distribution across all network components. Additionally, the controller exhibited exceptional scalability, effectively responding to over 98% of vehicle requests even in scenarios of extreme traffic demand.

Abstract: Accurate and energy efficient localization remains a key challenge in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), particularly when obstacles affect signal propagation. This study introduces AOASS (Adaptive Obstacle Aware Square Spiral), a new single mobile anchor framework that combines an optimized square spiral movement pattern with adaptive obstacle detection. The mobile anchor can sense and bypass obstacles while maintaining high localization accuracy and full network coverage, ensuring that each node receives at least three noncollinear beacon signals for reliable position estimation. Localization accuracy is further improved using the OLSTM DV Hop model, which integrates a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with the traditional DV Hop algorithm to estimate hop distances better and reduce multi hop errors. The anchor trajectory is managed by a TD3 LSTM reinforcement learning agent, supported by a Kalman based prediction layer and a fuzzy logic ORCA safety module for smooth and collision free navigation. Simulation experiments across different obstacle densities show that AOASS consistently achieves higher localization accuracy, better energy efficiency, and more optimized trajectories than existing approaches. These results demonstrate the framework scalability and potential for real world WSN applications, offering an intelligent and adaptable solution for data driven IoT systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence-generated traffic is changing the shape of wireless networks. Specifically, as the amount of data generated to train machine learning models is massive, network resources must be carefully allocated to continue supporting standard applications. In this paper, we tackle the problem of allocating radio resources for two sets of concurrent devices communicating in uplink with a gateway over the same bandwidth. A set of devices performs federated learning (FL), and accesses the medium in FDMA, uploading periodically large models. The other set is throughput-oriented and accesses the medium via random access (RA), either with ALOHA or slotted-ALOHA protocols. We derive close-to-optimal solutions to the non-convex problem of minimizing the system energy consumption subject to FL latency and RA throughput constraints. Our solutions show that ALOHA can sustain high FL efficiency, yielding up to 48% lower consumption when the system is dominated by FL traffic. On the other hand, slotted-ALOHA becomes more efficient when RA traffic dominates, yielding 6% lower consumption.

Abstract: TriCloudEdge is a scalable three-tier cloud continuum that integrates far-edge devices, intermediate edge nodes, and central cloud services, working in parallel as a unified solution. At the far edge, ultra-low-cost microcontrollers can handle lightweight AI tasks, while intermediate edge devices provide local intelligence, and the cloud tier offers large-scale analytics, federated learning, model adaptation, and global identity management. The proposed architecture enables multi-protocols and technologies (WebSocket, MQTT, HTTP) compared to a versatile protocol (Zenoh) to transfer diverse bidirectional data across the tiers, offering a balance between computational challenges and latency requirements. Comparative implementations between these two architectures demonstrate the trade-offs between resource utilization and communication efficiency. The results show that TriCloudEdge can distribute computational challenges to address latency and privacy concerns. The work also presents tests of AI model adaptation on the far edge and the computational effort challenges under the prism of parallelism. This work offers a perspective on the practical continuum challenges of implementation aligned with recent research advances addressing challenges across the different cloud levels.

Abstract: Acoustic data transmission offers a compelling alternative to Bluetooth and NFC by leveraging the ubiquitous speakers and microphones in smartphones and IoT devices. However, most research in this field relies on simulations or limited on-device testing, which makes the real-world reliability of proposed schemes difficult to assess. We systematically reviewed 31 acoustic communication studies for commodity devices and found that none provided accessible source code. After contacting authors and re-implementing three promising schemes, we assembled a testbed of eight representative acoustic communication systems. Using over 11000 smartphone transmissions in both realistic indoor environments and an anechoic chamber, we provide a systematic and repeatable methodology for evaluating the reliability and generalizability of these schemes under real-world conditions. Our results show that many existing schemes face challenges in practical usage, largely due to severe multipath propagation indoors and varying audio characteristics across device models. To support future research and foster more robust evaluations, we release our re-implementations alongside the first comprehensive dataset of real-world acoustic transmissions. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of rigorous on-device testing and underscore the need for robust design strategies to bridge the gap between simulation results and reliable IoT deployments.
