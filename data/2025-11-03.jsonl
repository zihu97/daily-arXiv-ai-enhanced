This paper presents the first large-scale, longitudinal measurement\nstudy of a fully decentralized NAT traversal protocol, Direct Connection\nUpgrade through Relay (DCUtR), within the production libp2p-based IPFS network.\nDrawing on over 4.4 million traversal attempts from 85,000+ distinct networks\nacross 167 countries, we provide a definitive empirical analysis of modern P2P\nconnectivity. We establish a contemporary baseline success rate of $70\\% \\pm\n7.1\\%$ for the hole-punching stage, providing a crucial new benchmark for the\nfield. Critically, we empirically refute the long-held 'tribal knowledge' of\nUDP's superiority for NAT traversal, demonstrating that DCUtR's high-precision,\nRTT-based synchronization yields statistically indistinguishable success rates\nfor both TCP and QUIC ($\\sim70\\%$). Our analysis further validates the\nprotocol's design for permissionless environments by showing that success is\nindependent of relay characteristics and that the mechanism is highly\nefficient, with $97.6\\%$ of successful connections established on the first\nattempt.

This unique complexity demands an adaptive packet routing\nalgorithm that is asynchronous, risk-aware, and capable of balancing diverse\nand often conflicting QoS objectives in a decentralized manner. However,\nexisting methods fail to address this need, as they typically rely on\nimpractical synchronous decision-making and/or risk-oblivious approaches. To\ntackle this gap, we introduce PRIMAL, an event-driven multi-agent routing\nframework designed specifically to allow each satellite to act independently on\nits own event-driven timeline, while managing the risk of worst-case\nperformance degradation via a principled primal-dual approach. This is achieved\nby enabling agents to learn the full cost distribution of the targeted QoS\nobjectives and constrain tail-end risks. Extensive simulations on a LEO\nconstellation with 1584 satellites validate its superiority in effectively\noptimizing latency and balancing load. Compared to a recent risk-oblivious\nbaseline, it reduces queuing delay by over 70%, and achieves a nearly 12 ms\nend-to-end delay reduction in loaded scenarios. This is accomplished by\nresolving the core conflict between naive shortest-path finding and congestion\navoidance, highlighting such autonomous risk-awareness as a key to robust\nrouting."}
