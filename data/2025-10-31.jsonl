However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on\ntechnical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream\n\"silent fixes\", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a\ndangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable\nthe necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,\nwe conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a\nholistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical\nframework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External\nThreat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a\ncritical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an\nundefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the\nimpact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical\nchain: \"Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation\" (OTVM). This\nprovides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.\nBased on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a \"Strategic Objectives Matrix\"\nto clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,\nEx-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and\n(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these\nvulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three\nindustry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.\nThis work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for\nenterprises to shift from reactive \"firefighting\" to proactively building an\norganizational \"immune system\"."}

Addressing these questions requires\nunderstanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However,\nprevious research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as\nsingle-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent\ninteractions.

Recent advances in open-source, resource-efficient Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) offer promising new approaches for automating such\nhigh-level tasks. In this work, we critically evaluate five state-of-the-art\nopen-source LLMs, spanning 3B to 8B parameter sizes, on the EMR task for Python\ncode. We systematically assess functional correctness and code quality using\nautomated metrics and investigate the impact of prompting strategies by\ncomparing one-shot prompting to a Recursive criticism and improvement (RCI)\napproach. RCI-based prompting consistently outperforms one-shot prompting in\ntest pass rates and refactoring quality. The best-performing models,\nDeepseek-Coder-RCI and Qwen2.5-Coder-RCI, achieve test pass percentage (TPP)\nscores of 0.829 and 0.808, while reducing lines of code (LOC) per method from\n12.103 to 6.192 and 5.577, and cyclomatic complexity (CC) from 4.602 to 3.453\nand 3.294, respectively. A developer survey on RCI-generated refactorings shows\nover 70% acceptance, with Qwen2.5-Coder rated highest across all evaluation\ncriteria. In contrast, the original code scored below neutral, particularly in\nreadability and maintainability, underscoring the benefits of automated\nrefactoring guided by quality prompts. While traditional metrics like CC and\nLOC provide useful signals, they often diverge from human judgments,\nemphasizing the need for human-in-the-loop evaluation. Our open-source\nbenchmark offers a foundation for future research on automated refactoring with\nLLMs."}

While source code metrics provide useful indicators of\nvulnerabilities, software engineering process metrics can uncover patterns that\nlead to their introduction. Yet few studies have explored whether process\nmetrics can reveal risky development activities over time -- insights that are\nessential for anticipating and mitigating software vulnerabilities. This work\nhighlights the critical role of process metrics along with code changes in\nunderstanding and mitigating vulnerability reintroduction. We move beyond\nfile-level prediction and instead analyze security fixes at the commit level,\nfocusing not only on whether a single fix introduces a vulnerability but also\non the longer sequences of changes through which vulnerabilities evolve and\nre-emerge. Our approach emphasizes that reintroduction is rarely the result of\none isolated action, but emerges from cumulative development activities and\nsocio-technical conditions. To support this analysis, we conducted a case study\non the ImageMagick project by correlating longitudinal process metrics such as\nbus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with vulnerability reintroduction\nactivities, encompassing 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities. Our\nfindings show that reintroductions often align with increased issue spoilage\nand fluctuating issue density, reflecting short-term inefficiencies in issue\nmanagement and team responsiveness.

To maximize spectral\nefficiency while providing fairness among users, the base station (BS) needs to\nselects a subset of users for data transmission. Given that this problem is\nNP-hard, DRL-based methods have been proposed to infer the near-optimal\nsolutions in real-time, yet this approach has an intrinsic security problem.\nThis paper investigates how a group of adversarial users can exploit\nunsanitized raw CSIs to launch a throughput degradation attack. Most existing\nstudies only focused on systems in which adversarial users can obtain the exact\nvalues of victims' CSIs, but this is impractical in the case of uplink\ntransmission in LTE/5G mobile systems. We note that the DRL policy contains an\nobservation normalizer which has the mean and variance of the observation to\nimprove training convergence. Adversarial users can then estimate the upper and\nlower bounds of the local observations including the CSIs of victims based\nsolely on that observation normalizer. We develop an attacking scheme FGGM by\nleveraging polytope abstract domains, a technique used to bound the outputs of\na neural network given the input ranges. Our goal is to find one set of\nintentionally manipulated CSIs which can achieve the attacking goals for the\nwhole range of local observations of victims. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat FGGM can determine a set of adversarial CSI vector controlled by\nadversarial users, then reuse those CSIs throughout the simulation to reduce\nthe network throughput of a victim up to 70\\% without knowing the exact value\nof victims' local observations.
