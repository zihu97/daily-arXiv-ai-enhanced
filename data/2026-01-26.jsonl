Modern platforms with matrix multiplication accelerators exhibit high FLOP/Byte machine balance, which makes implementing optimal matrix multiplication challenging. On modern CPU platforms with matrix engines, state-of-the-art vendor libraries tune input tensor layouts, parallelization schemes, and cache blocking to minimize data movement across the memory hierarchy and maximize throughput. However, the best settings for these parameters depend strongly on the target platform (number of cores, memory hierarchy, cache sizes) and on the shapes of the matrices, making exhaustive tuning infeasible; in practice this leads to performance \"glass jaws\". In this work we revisit space filling curves (SFC) to alleviate the problem of this cumbersome tuning. SFC convert multi-dimensional coordinates (e.g. 2D) into a single dimension (1D), keeping nearby points in the high-dimensional space close in the 1D order. We partition the Matrix Multiplication computation space using recent advancements in generalized SFC (Generalized Hilbert Curves), and we obtain platform-oblivious and shape-oblivious matrix-multiplication schemes that exhibit inherently high degree of data locality. Furthermore, we extend the SFC-based work partitioning to implement Communication-Avoiding (CA) algorithms that replicate the input tensors and provably minimize communication/data-movement on the critical path. The integration of CA-algorithms is seamless and yields compact code (~30 LOC), yet it achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple CPU platforms, outperforming vendor libraries by up to 2x(geometric-mean speedup) for a range of GEMM shapes."}

However, its efficient deployment on Huawei's Ascend 910 Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is challenging due to limited native mixed-precision support and the accelerator's decoupled compute architecture. To enable quantization on such architecture, we present the first practical W4A16 matrix multiplication kernel tailored for the Ascend 910 NPU. Our design leverages vector cores for on-the-fly INT4-to-FP16 dequantization, cube cores for high-throughput GEMM, and Split-K parallelization to mitigate memory latency. Performance evaluations across diverse matrix shapes and batch sizes show our method outperforms data-parallel approaches when K >> N, a typical scenario in LLM decoding. Specially, our method can achieve a speedup ranging from 1.01x to 1.74x. In addition, our profile reveals the primary bottleneck is not dequantization compution itself, but extra global memory transfer for the weight, making W4A16 only reaching a maximum speedup of 1.48x over native FP16xFP16 matrix multiplication in PyTorch. In the long run, our method lays a solid foundation and provides insightful views for the efficient deployment of quantized large language models on various domain-specific accelerators."}

Traditional rate allocation and congestion control mechanisms in wireless networks treat users uniformly based on channel conditions, rely only on network-centric Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and ignore the content diversity, which can lead to inefficient resource utilization and degraded UX. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Multi-User Content Diversity, which recognizes that different users concurrently consume media with varying complexity, and therefore have different bitrate requirements to achieve satisfactory UX. We propose multiple different frameworks that exploit multi-user content diversity and lead to overall network-wide gains in terms of UX. For each framework, we demonstrate the required information exchange between Application Servers (ASs), Application Clients (ACs), and the network, and the algorithms that run in each of these components to optimize a network-wide UXbased objective. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting multi-user content diversity leads to significant gains in UX capacity, UX fairness, and network utilization, when compared to conventional rate control methods. These findings highlight the potential of content-aware networking as a key enabler for emerging wireless systems."}

These two approaches to software verification have long been presented as opposites. One is dynamic, the other static: a test executes the program, a proof only analyzes the program text. A different perspective is emerging, in which testing and proving are complementary rather than competing techniques for producing software of verified quality.\n  Work performed over the past few years and reviewed here develops this complementarity by taking advantage of Design by Contract, as available in Eiffel, and exploiting a feature of modern program-proving tools based on ``Satisfiability Modulo Theories'' (SMT): counterexample generation. A counterexample is an input combination that makes the program fail. If we are trying to prove a program correct, we hope not to find any. One can, however, apply counterexample generation to incorrect programs, as a tool for automatic test generation. We can also introduce faults into a correct program and turn the counterexamples into an automatically generated regression test suite with full coverage. Additionally, we can use these mechanisms to help produce program fixes for incorrect programs, with a guarantee that the fixes are correct. All three applications, leveraging on the mechanisms of Eiffel and Design by Contract, hold significant promise to address some of the challenges of program testing, software maintenance and Automatic Program Repair."}

In this system, BLSs harvest energy from the UAV and utilize the harvested energy to transmit the collected data back to the UAV. The goal is to maximize the collected data volume and fairness index while minimizing the UAV energy consumption. To achieve these objectives, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the transmit power and UAV trajectory. Due to the non-convexity and dynamic nature of the problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, this algorithm integrates prioritized experience replay and the performer module to enhance system stability and accelerate convergence.

Checkpointing this massive, distributed state is critical for a wide range of use cases, such as resilience, suspend-resume, investigating undesirable training trajectories, and explaining model evolution. However, existing checkpointing solutions typically treat model state as opaque binary blobs, ignoring the ``3D heterogeneity'' of the underlying data structures--varying by memory location (GPU vs. Host), number of ``logical'' objects sharded and split across multiple files, data types (tensors vs. Python objects), and their serialization requirements. This results in significant runtime overheads due to blocking device-to-host transfers, data-oblivious serialization, and storage I/O contention. In this paper, we introduce DataStates-LLM, a novel checkpointing architecture that leverages State Providers to decouple state abstraction from data movement. DataStates-LLM exploits the immutability of model parameters during the forward and backward passes to perform ``lazy'', non-blocking asynchronous snapshots. By introducing State Providers, we efficiently coalesce fragmented, heterogeneous shards and overlap the serialization of metadata with bulk tensor I/O. We evaluate DataStates-LLM on models up to 70B parameters on 256 A100-40GB GPUs. Our results demonstrate that DataStates-LLM achieves up to 4$\\times$ higher checkpointing throughput and reduces end-to-end training time by up to 2.2$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions, effectively mitigating the serialization and heterogeneity bottlenecks in extreme-scale LLM training."}

We derive 58 distinct linguistic patterns from 730 manually labeled concurrency bug reports, organized across four levels: word-level (keywords), phrase-level (n-grams), sentence-level (semantic), and bug report-level (contextual). To assess their effectiveness, we evaluate four complementary approaches-matching, learning, prompt-based, and fine-tuning-spanning traditional machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and pre-trained language models (PLMs). Our comprehensive evaluation on 12 large-scale open-source projects (10,920 issue reports from GitHub and Jira) demonstrates that fine-tuning PLMs with linguistic-pattern-enriched inputs achieves the best performance, reaching a precision of 91% on GitHub and 93% on Jira, and maintaining strong precision on post cut-off data (91%). The contributions of this work include: (1) a comprehensive taxonomy of linguistic patterns for concurrency bugs, (2) a novel fine-tuning strategy that integrates domain-specific linguistic knowledge into PLMs, and (3) a curated, labeled dataset to support reproducible research.

It targets low-latency, resource-constrained applications with large data volumes, requiring tight integration of wireless access and on-site computing. Yet system performance and cost-efficiency hinge on joint pre-deployment dimensioning of radio and computational resources, especially under spatial and temporal uncertainty. Prior work largely emphasizes run-time allocation or relies on simplified models that decouple radio and computing, missing end-to-end correlations in large-scale deployments. This paper introduces a unified stochastic framework to dimension multi-cell edge-intelligent systems. We model network topology with Poisson point processes, capturing random user and base-station locations, inter-cell interference, distance-based fractional power control, and peak-power constraints. By combining this with queueing theory and empirical AI inference workload profiling, we derive tractable expressions for end-to-end offloading delay. These enable a non-convex joint optimization that minimizes deployment cost under statistical QoS guarantees, expressed through strict tail-latency and inference-accuracy constraints. We prove the problem decomposes into convex subproblems, yielding global optimality. Numerical results in noise- and interference-limited regimes identify cost-efficient design regions and configurations that cause under-utilization or user unfairness. Smaller cells reduce transmission delay but raise per-request computing cost due to weaker server multiplexing, whereas larger cells show the opposite trend. Densification reduces computational costs only when frequency reuse scales with base-station density; otherwise, sparser deployments improve fairness and efficiency in interference-limited settings."}

Our findings explore Wi-Fi's performance anomaly and demonstrate that Intra-refresh (IR) coding effectively reduces latency variability and improves QoS, supporting up to 4 concurrent VR users with Constant Bitrate (CBR) 100 Mbps before the channel is saturated."}

Benchmarks are needed to soundly evaluate these systems and understand their performance. To enable such a study, we curate a benchmark of real-world contextualized questions derived from Github pull request comments. Out of this work, we present RubberDuckBench: a multilingual benchmark of questions about code, along with detailed rubrics for evaluating answers. We evaluate a diverse set of 20 LLMs (proprietary & open-source) on answering these questions. We find that even state of the art models fail to give consistent, correct responses across the benchmark. Grok 4 (69.29%), Claude Opus 4 (68.5%), and GPT-5 (67.8%) perform best overall, but do not exhibit pairwise significant superiority over the next 9 best performing models. Most models obtain points through partial credit, with the best performing models only answering at most 2 questions completely correctly across all trials. Furthermore, models often hallucinate with lies in 58.3\\% of responses on average. Cost analysis reveals no correlation between expense (API pricing or parameter count) and performance. We intend this benchmark to be a target for future research in trustworthy and correct AI coding assistants."}

Due to the complex and tedious construction process, large-scale configuration is relatively inefficient. However, most methods always overlook fine-grained analysis of the actions performed by the agent, making it difficult to handle complex errors and resulting in configuration failures. To address this bottleneck, we propose EvoConfig, an efficient environment configuration framework that optimizes multi-agent collaboration to build correct runtime environments. EvoConfig features an expert diagnosis module for fine-grained post-execution analysis, and a self-evolving mechanism that lets expert agents self-feedback and dynamically adjust error-fixing priorities in real time. Empirically, EvoConfig matches the previous state-of-the-art Repo2Run on Repo2Run's 420 repositories, while delivering clear gains on harder cases: on the more challenging Envbench, EvoConfig achieves a 78.1% success rate, outperforming Repo2Run by 7.1%. Beyond end-to-end success, EvoConfig also demonstrates stronger debugging competence, achieving higher accuracy in error identification and producing more effective repair recommendations than existing methods."}

Beyond serving as code auto-completion tools in integrated development environments, large language models increasingly function as foundation models within coding agents in vibe-coding scenarios. In such settings, prompts play a central role in agent-based intelligent software development, as they not only guide the behavior of large language models but also serve as carriers of user requirements. Under the dominant conversational paradigm, prompts are typically divided into system prompts and user prompts. System prompts provide high-level instructions to steer model behavior and establish conversational context, while user prompts represent inputs and requirements provided by human users. Despite their importance, designing effective prompts remains challenging, as it requires expertise in both prompt engineering and software engineering, particularly requirements engineering. To reduce the burden of manual prompt construction, numerous automated prompt engineering methods have been proposed. However, most existing approaches neglect the methodological principles of requirements engineering, limiting their ability to generate artifacts that conform to formal requirement specifications in realistic software development scenarios. To address this gap, we propose REprompt, a multi-agent prompt optimization framework guided by requirements engineering. Experiment results demonstrate that REprompt effectively optimizes both system and user prompts by grounding prompt generation in requirements engineering principles."}

Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in terms of its comprehensiveness, scale, and language coverage on how to improve code translation accuracy using code comments."}

Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter. Moreover, LuaJIT approaches C's efficiency, using roughly six times more energy and running about eight times slower, demonstrating the substantial benefits of JIT compilation for improving both performance and energy efficiency in interpreted languages."}

This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements. By keeping stakeholders in the validation loop, this approach promotes responsible and trustworthy use of AI in Requirements Engineering."}

While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier. We summarize a set of actionable implications for developers, organizations, and tool vendors seeking to advance artificial intelligence (AI) assisted software development."}

In the age of service-orientation (a.k.a. Software as a Service (SaaS)) APIs have become core business assets and can easily expose hundreds of operations. While well-designed APIs contribute to the commercial success of a service, poorly designed APIs can threaten entire organizations. Recognizing their relevance and value, many guidelines have been proposed for designing usable APIs, similar to design patterns and coding standards. For example, Zalando and Microsoft provide popular REST API guidelines. However, they are often considered as too large and inapplicable, so many companies create and maintain their own guidelines, which is a challenge in itself. In practice, however, developers still struggle to design effective REST APIs. To improve the situation, we need to improve our empirical understanding of adopting, using, and creating REST API guidelines.\n  We present an interview study with 16 REST API experts from industry. We determine the notion of API usability, guideline effectiveness factors, challenges of adopting and designing guidelines, and best practices. We identified eight factors influencing REST API usability, among which the adherence to conventions is the most important one. While guidelines can in fact be an effective means to improve API usability, there is significant resistance from developers against strict guidelines. Guideline size and how it fits with organizational needs are two important factors to consider. REST guidelines also have to grow with the organization, while all stakeholders need to be involved in their development and maintenance. Automated linting provides an opportunity to not only embed compliance enforcement into processes, but also to justify guideline rules with educational explanations."}

While various context compression approaches such as LongLLMLingua have emerged to tackle this challenge, they typically rely on fixed metrics such as PPL, ignoring the task-specific nature of code understanding. As a result, they frequently disrupt syntactic and logical structure and fail to retain critical implementation details. In this paper, we propose SWE-Pruner, a self-adaptive context pruning framework tailored for coding agents. Drawing inspiration from how human programmers \"selectively skim\" source code during development and debugging, SWE-Pruner performs task-aware adaptive pruning for long contexts. Given the current task, the agent formulates an explicit goal (e.g., \"focus on error handling\") as a hint to guide the pruning targets. A lightweight neural skimmer (0.6B parameters) is trained to dynamically select relevant lines from the surrounding context given the goal. Evaluations across four benchmarks and multiple models validate SWE-Pruner's effectiveness in various scenarios, achieving 23-54% token reduction on agent tasks like SWE-Bench Verified and up to 14.84x compression on single-turn tasks like LongCodeQA with minimal performance impact."}

In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines. Our findings indicate that current state-of-the-art foundation models provide a practical and low-effort complement to traditional variability-aware analyses."}

Deciphering the Fate of AI-Generated Code in Open Source", "comment": "This paper has been submitted to EASE 2026 research track and currently under review", "summary": "The integration of AI agents as coding assistants into software development has raised questions about the long-term viability of AI agent-generated code. A prevailing hypothesis within the software engineering community suggests this code is \"disposable\", meaning it is merged quickly but discarded shortly thereafter. If true, organizations risk shifting maintenance burden from generation to post-deployment remediation. We investigate this hypothesis through survival analysis of 201 open-source projects, tracking over 200,000 code units authored by AI agents versus humans. Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p < 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cramér's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics. The bottleneck for agent-generated code may not be generation quality, but the organizational practices that govern its long-term evolution."}

This data mining challenge focuses on AIDev, the first large-scale, openly available dataset capturing agent-authored pull requests (Agentic-PRs) from real-world GitHub repositories. Our paper leverages this dataset to investigate (RQ1) whether AI coding agents generate build code with quality issues (e.g., code smells), (RQ2) to what extent AI agents can eliminate code smells from build code, and (RQ3) to what extent Agentic-PRs are accepted by developers. We identified 364 maintainability and security-related build smells across varying severity levels, indicating that AI-generated build code can introduce quality issues-such as lack of error handling, and hardcoded paths or URLs-while also, in some cases, removing existing smells through refactorings (e.g., Pull Up Module and Externalize Properties). Notably, more than 61\\% of Agentic-PRs are approved and merged with minimal human intervention.

Our framework integrates into an industrial game testing pipeline, enabling developers to receive immediate coverage feedback on tests run against their changes. The compilation overhead of our approach is minimal, allowing instrumentation of over 2,000 commits before doubling build time.
