Existing Lookup Table (LUT)-based DNNs -- such as LogicNets, PolyLUT, and NeuraLUT -- face two critical challenges: the exponential growth of LUT size and inefficient random sparse connectivity. This paper presents SparseLUT, a comprehensive framework that addresses these challenges through two orthogonal optimizations. First, we propose an architectural enhancement that aggregates multiple PolyLUT sub-neurons via an adder, significantly reducing LUT consumption by 2.0x-13.9x and lowering inference latency by 1.2x-1.6x, all while maintaining comparable accuracy. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce a non-greedy training algorithm that optimizes neuron connectivity by selectively pruning less significant inputs and strategically regrowing more effective ones. This training optimization, which incurs no additional area and latency overhead, delivers consistent accuracy improvements across benchmarks -- achieving up to a 2.13% gain on MNIST and 0.94% on Jet Substructure Classification compared to existing LUT-DNN approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "SparseLUT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0e\u975e\u8d2a\u5fc3\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLUT\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709LUT-DNN\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u7684LUT\u89c4\u6a21\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u8fde\u63a5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u6cd5\u5668\u805a\u5408\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u8d2a\u5fc3\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u518d\u751f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "LUT\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c112.0x-13.9x\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e1.2x-1.6x\uff0cMNIST\u4e0eJet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53472.13%\u4e0e0.94%\u3002", "conclusion": "SparseLUT\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72DNN\u65f6\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

We propose a threshold-based admission policy that redirects non-urgent patients to alternative care pathways, such as telemedicine, during peak congestion. The ED is modeled as a two-class $M/M/c$ preemptive-priority queuing system, where high-acuity patients are prioritized and low-acuity patients are subject to state-dependent redirection. Analyzed via a level-dependent Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) process, the model determines the optimal threshold by maximizing a long-run time-averaged objective function comprising redirection-affected revenue and costs associated with patient balking and system occupancy. Numerical analysis using national healthcare data reveals that optimal policies are highly context-dependent. While rural EDs generally optimize at lower redirection thresholds, urban EDs exhibit performance peaks at moderate thresholds.

However, the diversity of XR workloads is rapidly increasing, characterized by heterogeneous operator types and complex dataflow structures. This trend poses significant challenges to conventional accelerator architectures centered around convolutional neural networks (CNNs), resulting in diminishing returns for traditional compute-centric optimization strategies. Despite the importance of this problem, a systematic architectural understanding of the full XR pipeline remains lacking. In this paper, we present an architectural classification of XR workloads using a cross-layer methodology that integrates model-based high-level design space exploration (DSE) with empirical profiling on commercial GPU and CPU hardware. By analyzing a representative set of workloads spanning 12 distinct XR kernels, we distill their complex architectural characteristics into a small set of cross-layer workload archetypes (e.g., capacity-limited and overhead-sensitive). Building on these archetypes, we further extract key architectural insights and provide actionable design guidelines for next-generation XR SoCs.

This paper studies a heterogeneous distributed linearly separable computation problem, including one master and N distributed workers. The linearly separable task function involves Kc linear combinations of K messages, where each message is a function of one dataset. Distinguished from the existing homogeneous settings that assume each worker holds the same number of datasets, where the data assignment is carefully designed and controlled by the data center (e.g., the cyclic assignment), we consider a more general setting with arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment across workers, where `arbitrary' means that the data assignment is given in advance and `heterogeneous' means that the workers may hold different numbers of datasets. Our objective is to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the computable dimension of the task function and the communication cost under arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment. Under the constraint of integer communication costs, for arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment, we propose a universal computing scheme and a universal converse bound by characterizing the structure of data assignment, where they coincide under some parameter regimes. We then extend the proposed computing scheme and converse bound to the case of fractional communication costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5f02\u6784\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5076\u754c\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4efb\u52a1\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u540c\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u914d\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u5206\u914d\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5076\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5206\u6570\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u60c5\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6574\u6570\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5076\u754c\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u95f4\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u4ea6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Furthermore, VarMRI introduces an analysis method that is efficient on large amount of data, robust on different data set and against missing data, and informative to the user.\n  VarMRI has helped us to carry out a 3,000-hour study of six applications and benchmarks on CloudLab. It reveals a wide variety of events causing latency variance, including interrupt preemption, Java GC, pipeline stall, NUMA balancing etc.; simple optimization or tuning can reduce tail latencies by up to 31%.

We investigate whether multi-agent systems function as strategic reasoners capable of payoff optimization or as identity-driven actors that prioritize role alignment over explicit incentives. Using Nash equilibrium achievement as a diagnostic for strategic reasoning, we conduct systematic experiments across four LLM architectures (Qwen-7B, Qwen-32B, Llama-8B, Mistral-7B) in complex environmental decision-making games involving four agents. We show that role identity bias fundamentally alters strategic reasoning even when payoff-optimal equilibria exist and complete payoff information is available. Removing personas and providing explicit payoffs enables Qwen models to achieve high Nash equilibrium rates, indicating that both conditions are necessary for strategic reasoning. In contrast, personas systematically bias equilibrium selection toward socially preferred outcomes: with personas present, all of the achieved equilibria correspond to Green Transition, while models entirely fail to reach equilibrium when Tragedy of the Commons is payoff-optimal. The effect of explicit payoffs depends entirely on persona presence, revealing strong interactions between representational design choices. We also observe clear model-dependent patterns. Qwen architectures are highly sensitive to both personas and payoff visibility, whereas Llama and Mistral exhibit rigid reasoning behavior across conditions. These findings demonstrate that representational choices are substantive governance decisions that determine whether multi-agent systems act as strategic reasoners or identity-driven actors, with important implications for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u89d2\u8272\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u5747\u8861\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0e\u6536\u76ca\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56db\u79cdLLM\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u5883\u51b3\u7b56\u535a\u5f08\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u8fbe\u6210\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u79fb\u9664\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u6536\u76ca\u53ef\u4f7fQwen\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5747\u8861\u7387\uff1b\u89d2\u8272\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u5747\u8861\u504f\u5411\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u5f81\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u8005\u6216\u8eab\u4efd\u9a71\u52a8\u8005\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Existing methods mainly rely on spatio-temporal interaction paradigms, where the sequential execution of multi-round dialogues incurs high latency and computation. Motivated by the recent insights that evaluation and debate mechanisms can improve problem-solving in multi-agent systems, we propose TopoDIM, a framework for one-shot Topology generation with Diverse Interaction Modes. Designed for decentralized execution to enhance adaptability and privacy, TopoDIM enables agents to autonomously construct heterogeneous communication without iterative coordination, achieving token efficiency and improved task performance.

Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automation, their susceptibility to hallucinations limits reliable application. Existing hybrid approaches mitigate this issue by constraining LLMs with formal models, but still rely on costly manual modeling. To solve this problem, this paper proposes RAFT, a framework for requirements auto-formalization and compliance test generation via explicating tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs. RAFT employs an Adaptive Purification-Aggregation strategy to explicate tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs and integrate it into three artifacts: a domain meta-model, a formal requirements representation, and testability constraints. These artifacts are then dynamically injected into prompts to guide high-precision requirement formalization and automated test generation.

Additionally, we study a subset of active repositories on a monthly basis to track changes in adherence to coding standards over time. We found widespread violations across repositories, with Javadoc and Naming violations being the most common. We also found a significant number of violations of the GOOGLE Java Style Guide in categories often missed by modern static analysis tools. Furthermore, repositories claiming to follow code-style practices exhibited slightly higher overall adherence to code-style and best-practices.

Fun activities can activate students and, if well designed, can also help remember and reflect on abstract software development concepts. We present a novel catalogue of ten physical fun activities, developed over years to reflect on basic programming and software development concepts. The catalogue includes the execution of a LA-OLA algorithm as in stadiums, using paper planes to simulate object messages and pointers, and traversing a lecture hall as a tree or a recursive structure. We report our experience of using the activities in a large course with 500+ students three years in a row. We also conducted an interview study with 15 former students of the course and 14 experienced educators from around the globe.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities for supporting various software engineering activities, but their use for detecting code smells remains underexplored. However, unlike the rigid rules of static analysis tools, LLMs can support flexible and adaptable detection strategies tailored to the unique properties of code smells. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of four LLMs -- DeepSeek-R1, GPT-5 mini, Llama-3.3, and Qwen2.5-Code -- for detecting nine code smells across 30 Java projects. For the empirical evaluation, we created a ground-truth dataset by asking 76 developers to manually inspect 268 code-smell candidates. Our results indicate that LLMs perform strongly for structurally straightforward smells, such as Large Class and Long Method. However, we also observed that different LLMs and tools fare better for distinct code smells. We then propose and evaluate a detection strategy that combines LLMs and static analysis tools. The proposed strategy outperforms LLMs and tools in five out of nine code smells in terms of F1-Score. However, it also generates more false positives for complex smells. Therefore, we conclude that the optimal strategy depends on whether Recall or Precision is the main priority for code smell detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u5f02\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u5473\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u591a\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u89c4\u5219\u50f5\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u572830\u4e2aJava\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cdLLM\u5bf9\u4e5d\u79cd\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5f02\u5473\uff08\u5982Large Class\u3001Long Method\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u5f02\u5473\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u5473\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u4f18\u5148\u5173\u6ce8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fd8\u662f\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification).

However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) hybrid testing tools do not fully exploit the capabilities of symbolic execution and sampling in two key aspects. First, the SOTA hybrid testing tools employ tailored symbolic execution engines that tend to over-prune branches, leading to considerable time wasted waiting for seeds from the fuzzer and missing opportunities to discover crashes. Second, existing methods do not apply sampling to the appropriate branches and therefore cannot utilize the full capability of sampling. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel hybrid testing architecture that combines the precision of conventional symbolic execution with the scalability of tailored symbolic execution engines. Based on this architecture, we propose several principles for combining fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling. We implement our method in a hybrid testing tool S$^2$F. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on 15 real-world programs. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^2$F outperforms the SOTA tool, achieving an average improvement of 6.14% in edge coverage and 32.6% in discovered crashes.

To address this challenge, researchers are increasingly utilizing Machine Learning approaches to identify malware through behavioral (i.e. dynamic) cues. However, current approaches are limited by their reliance on large labeled datasets, fixed model training, and the assumption that a trained model remains effective over time-disregarding the ever-evolving sophistication of malware. As a result, they often fail to detect evolving malware attacks that adapt over time. This paper proposes an online learning approach for dynamic malware detection, that overcomes these limitations by incorporating temporal information to continuously update its models using behavioral features, specifically process resource utilization metrics. By doing so, the proposed models can incrementally adapt to emerging threats and detect zero-day malware effectively.

Exposure-Aware Evaluation of Bug-vs-Fix Preference in Code LLMs", "comment": "MSR 2026 Technical Track", "summary": "Large language models are increasingly used for code generation and debugging, but their outputs can still contain bugs, that originate from training data. Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u66b4\u9732\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u800c\u8f93\u51fa\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u504f\u597d\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528ManySStuBs4J\u57fa\u51c6\u548cData Portraits\u6210\u5458\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790Stack-V2\u8bed\u6599\u4e2dbug\u4e0efix\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u66b4\u9732\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u8bc4\u5206\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "67%\u6837\u672c\u672a\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\uff1b\u82e5\u4ec5\u4e00\u7248\u672c\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u7248\u66f4\u5e38\u89c1\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u590d\u73b0bug\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u66b4\u9732\u4e8ebug\u65f6\uff1b\u6700\u5c0f/\u6700\u5927token\u6982\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u4fee\u590d\u7248\uff0cGini\u7cfb\u6570\u5728\u4ec5\u89c1bug\u65f6\u53cd\u8f6c\u504f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9bug-fix\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4f20\u64ad\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}
