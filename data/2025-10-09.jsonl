In many\nsoftware teams, cybersecurity experts are either entirely absent or represented\nby only a small number of specialists. As a result, the workload for these\nexperts becomes high, and software engineers would need to conduct\ncybersecurity activities themselves. This creates a need for a tool to support\ncybersecurity experts and engineers in evaluating vulnerabilities and threats\nduring the risk assessment process. This paper explores the potential of\nleveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented\ngeneration to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain\nwhile complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit\nexternal data sharing. We performed a design science study involving 12 experts\nin interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project.\nThe results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by\ngenerating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing\nredundancy checks. The results also highlight the necessity for human oversight\nto ensure accuracy and compliance. Despite trust concerns, experts were willing\nto utilize LLMs in specific evaluation and assistance roles, rather than solely\nrelying on their generative capabilities. This study provides insights that\nencourage the use of LLM-based agents to support the risk assessment process of\ncyber-physical systems in safety-critical domains."}

Static partitioning of\nthe data structure for distribution is not desirable, as it is prone to uneven\nload distribution over time, and having to change the partitioning scheme later\nwill require downtime.\n  Since a distributed data structure, inherently, relies on communication\nsupport from the network stack and operating systems, we introduce the notion\nof conditional lock-freedom that extends the notion of lock-free computation\nwith reasonable assumptions about communication between processes. We present\nDiLi, a conditional lock-free, linearizable, and distributable linked list that\ncan be asynchronously and dynamically (1) partitioned into multiple sublists\nand (2) load balanced by distributing sublists across multiple machines. DiLi\ncontains primitives for these that also maintain the lock-free property of the\nunderlying search structure that supports find, remove, and insert of a key as\nthe client operations.\n  Searching for an item in DiLi is by a novel traversal that involves a binary\nsearch on the partitioning scheme, and then a linear traversal on a limitable\nnumber of linked nodes.

Tools supporting the mining process are commonly\napplied by researchers and practitioners, but their limitations and agreement\nare often not well understood.\n  Objective: This study investigates some threats to validity in complex tool\npipelines for evolutionary software analyses and evaluates the tools' agreement\nin terms of data, study outcomes and conclusions for the same research\nquestions.\n  Method: We conduct a lightweight literature review to select three studies on\ncollaboration and coordination, software maintenance and software quality from\nhigh-ranked venues, which we formally replicate with four independent,\nsystematically selected mining tools to quantitatively and qualitatively\ncompare the extracted data, analysis results and conclusions.\n  Results: We find that numerous technical details in tool design and\nimplementation accumulate along the complex mining pipelines and can cause\nsubstantial differences in the extracted baseline data, its derivatives,\nsubsequent results of statistical analyses and, under specific circumstances,\nconclusions.\n  Conclusions: Users must carefully choose tools and evaluate their limitations\nto assess the scope of validity in an adequate way. Reusing tools is\nrecommended. Researchers and tool authors can promote reusability and help\nreducing uncertainties by reproduction packages and comparative studies\nfollowing our approach."}

To improve accuracy, a new family of approaches adds\ncarefully designed correlated noises, so that noises cancel out each other\nacross iterations.

Despite their importance, the proposal process\nis resource-intensive and often leads to contributor frustration, especially\nwhen proposals are declined without clear feedback. Yet, the reasons behind\nproposal rejection remain poorly understood, limiting opportunities to\nstreamline the process or guide contributors effectively. This study\ninvestigates the characteristics and outcomes of proposals in the Go\nprogramming language to understand why proposals are declined and how such\noutcomes might be anticipated. We conduct a mixed-method empirical study on\n1,091 proposals submitted to the Go project. We quantify proposal outcomes,\nbuild a taxonomy of decline reasons, and evaluate large language models (LLMs)\nfor predicting these outcomes. We find that proposals are more often declined\nthan accepted, and resolution typically takes over a month. Only 14.7% of\ndeclined proposals are ever resubmitted. Through qualitative coding, we\nidentify nine key reasons for proposal decline, such as duplication, limited\nuse cases, or violations of project principles. This taxonomy can help\ncontributors address issues in advance, e.g., checking for existing\nalternatives can reduce redundancy. We also demonstrate that GPT-based models\ncan predict decline decisions early in the discussion (F1 score = 0.71 with\npartial comments), offering a practical tool for prioritizing review effort.\nOur findings reveal inefficiencies in the proposal process and highlight\nactionable opportunities for improving both contributor experience and reviewer\nworkload by enabling early triage and guiding contributors to strengthen their\nproposals using a structured understanding of past decline reasons."}

While existing\nautoscaling mechanisms focus entirely on resource scaling, Edge devices require\nalternative ways to sustain the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of competing\nservices. To address these issues, we introduce a Multi-dimensional Autoscaling\nPlatform (MUDAP) that supports fine-grained vertical scaling across both\nservice- and resource-level dimensions. MUDAP supports service-specific scaling\ntailored to available parameters, e.g., scale data quality or model size for a\nparticular service. To optimize the execution across services, we present a\nscaling agent based on Regression Analysis of Structural Knowledge (RASK). The\nRASK agent efficiently explores the solution space and learns a continuous\nregression model of the processing environment for inferring optimal scaling\nactions. We compared our approach with two autoscalers, the Kubernetes VPA and\na reinforcement learning agent, for scaling up to 9 services on a single Edge\ndevice. Our results showed that RASK can infer an accurate regression model in\nmerely 20 iterations (i.e., observe 200s of processing).
