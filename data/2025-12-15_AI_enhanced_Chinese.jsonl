Consequently, there is a growing need for more efficient testing methods. To reduce the burden on developers, various automated test generation tools have been developed, and several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the tests they produce. However, most of these studies focus primarily on coverage metrics, and only a few examine how well the tests support fault localization-particularly using artificial faults introduced through mutation testing. In this study, we compare the SBFL (Spectrum-Based Fault Localization) score and code coverage of automatically generated tests with those of manually created tests. The SBFL score indicates how accurately faults can be localized using SBFL techniques. By employing SBFL score as an evaluation metric-an approach rarely used in prior studies on test generation-we aim to provide new insights into the respective strengths and weaknesses of manually created and automatically generated tests. Our experimental results show that automatically generated tests achieve higher branch coverage than manually created tests, but their SBFL score is lower, especially for code with deeply nested structures. These findings offer guidance on how to effectively combine automatically generated and manually created testing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728SBFL\u5f97\u5206\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u4f46\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8d1f\u62c5\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SBFL\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u5206\u652f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u652f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46SBFL\u5f97\u5206\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u5d4c\u5957\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u4e0e\u624b\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0e\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, despite their promising capabilities, CodeLLMs can inadvertently memorize and reproduce snippets from their training data, which poses risks of privacy breaches and intellectual property violations. These risks restrict the deployment of CodeLLMs in sensitive domains and limit their training datasets to publicly available sources. To mitigate the memorization risk without compromising their task performance, we apply Differential Privacy (DP) to CodeLLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of DP in CodeLLMs. DP adds calibrated noise to the training process to protect individual data points while still allowing the model to learn useful patterns. To this end, we first identify and understand the driving reasons of the memorization behaviour of the CodeLLMs during their fine-tuning. Then, to address this issue, we empirically evaluate the effect of DP on mitigating memorization while preserving code generation capabilities. Our findings show that DP substantially reduces memorization in CodeLLMs across all the tested snippet types. The snippet types most prone to memorization are also the most effectively mitigated by DP. Furthermore, we observe that DP slightly increases perplexity but preserves, and can even enhance, the code generation capabilities of CodeLLMs, which makes it feasible to apply DP in practice without significantly compromising model utility. Finally, we analyze the impact of DP on training efficiency and energy consumption, finding that DP does not significantly affect training time or energy usage, making it a practical choice for privacy-preserving CodeLLMs training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08CodeLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DP\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "CodeLLMs\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fb5\u72af\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u6821\u51c6\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "DP\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5404\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5bf9\u6613\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7247\u6bb5\u6548\u679c\u5c24\u4f73\uff1b\u8f7b\u5fae\u589e\u52a0\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f46\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u3001\u751a\u81f3\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u4e4e\u5176\u5fae\u3002", "conclusion": "DP\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u578bCodeLLMs\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, as prompts grow to tens of thousands of tokens, edge hardware performance drops sharply with sequence length due to quadratic prefill cost and rapidly increasing KV-cache bandwidth demands, making inference latency of longer context length a first-order system concern. Recent studies on LLMs expose a fundamental prefill-decode asymmetry: prefill is compute-bound and dominated by dense matrix-matrix operations, whereas decoding is memory-bandwidth-bound and dominated by KV-cache traffic. A static accelerator must provision resources and a single dataflow for both regimes, leading to duplicated attention logic, underutilized fabric, and tight LUT/URAM limits that cap model size and usable context. We propose a prefill--decode disaggregated LLM accelerator, PD-Swap, that uses Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) to time-multiplex the attention module on edge FPGAs. The core table-lookup ternary matrix multiplication and weight-buffering engines remain static, while the attention subsystem is a reconfigurable partition with two phase-specialized architectures: a compute-heavy, token-parallel prefill engine and a bandwidth-optimized, KV-cache-centric decoding engine.

This inefficiency is largely caused by fragmentation, heterogeneous workloads, and the limitations of static scheduling policies. This work presents a systematic evaluation of these issues and introduces three specialized dynamic schedulers: Hybrid Priority (HPS), Predictive Backfill (PBS), and Smart Batch (SBS). These schedulers are designed to improve utilization, fairness, and overall throughput in multi-tenant GPU clusters. We evaluate all schedulers using a controlled simulation of 1,000 AI jobs on a 64-GPU, 8-node cluster that includes a realistic mix of training, inference, and research workloads. Static baselines (FIFO, SJF, Shortest, Shortest-GPU) achieve 45 to 67% GPU utilization and 12.5 to 18.3 jobs per hour and experience severe starvation, with as many as 156 jobs waiting longer than 30 minutes. The dynamic schedulers significantly outperform these policies. HPS achieves the highest utilization (78.2%), highest throughput (25.8 jobs per hour), and the lowest fairness variance among dynamic methods (457), reducing starvation to 12 jobs. PBS improves fragmentation handling and reaches 76.1% utilization, while SBS increases efficiency for structurally similar jobs and reaches 74.6% utilization. Across all key metrics, including throughput, job wait times, fairness variance, and starvation, dynamic multi-objective schedulers consistently outperform single-objective heuristics.

However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable \"warm-star\" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs.

Parallax first partitions the computation DAG to expose parallelism, then employs branch-aware memory management with dedicated arenas and buffer reuse to reduce runtime footprint. An adaptive scheduler executes branches according to device memory constraints, meanwhile, fine-grained subgraph control enables heterogeneous inference of dynamic models.

However, the traditional requirement for manually assigned or centrally coordinated worker IDs introduces significant friction in modern container-orchestrated environments (e.g., Kubernetes), where workloads are ephemeral and autoscaled. In such systems, maintaining stable worker identities requires complex stateful sets or external coordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper), negating the operational benefits of stateless microservices.\n  This paper presents a cloud-agnostic, container-native ID generation protocol that eliminates the dependency on explicit worker IDs. By deriving node uniqueness deterministically from ephemeral network properties - specifically the container's private IPv4 address - the proposed method removes the need for centralized coordination. We introduce a modified bit-allocation scheme (1-41-16-6) that accommodates 16 bits of network-derived entropy while preserving strict monotonicity. We validate the approach across AWS, GCP, and Azure environments. Evaluation results demonstrate that while the design has a theoretical single-node ceiling of approximately 64,000 TPS, in practical microservice deployments the network I/O dominates latency, resulting in end-to-end performance (approximately 31,000 TPS on a 3-node cluster) comparable to classic stateful generators while offering effectively unbounded horizontal scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9ID\u7684\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fID\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bb9\u5668IP\u5730\u5740\u4f5c\u4e3a\u71b5\u6e90\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u9ad8\u6269\u5c55\u6027ID\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfSnowflake\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u8c03\u6216\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bb9\u5668\u79c1\u6709IPv4\u5730\u5740\u6d3e\u751f\u552f\u4e00\u8282\u70b9\u6807\u8bc6\uff0c\u91c7\u75281-41-16-6\u4f4d\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728AWS/GCP/Azure\u5b9e\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5355\u96c6\u7fa4\u8fbe31,000 TPS\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u8fd1\u4e4e\u65e0\u9650\u6a2a\u5411\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9ID\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u8fd0\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, the current practice of retraining a separate model for each camera suffers from high compute and communication costs, making it unscalable. We present ECCO, a new video analytics framework designed for resource-efficient continuous learning. The key insight is that the data drift, which necessitates model retraining, often shows temporal and spatial correlations across nearby cameras. By identifying cameras that experience similar drift and retraining a shared model for them, ECCO can substantially reduce the associated compute and communication costs. Specifically, ECCO introduces: (i) a lightweight grouping algorithm that dynamically forms and updates camera groups; (ii) a GPU allocator that dynamically assigns GPU resources across different groups to improve retraining accuracy and ensure fairness; and (iii) a transmission controller at each camera that configures frame sampling and coordinates bandwidth sharing with other cameras based on its assigned GPU resources. We conducted extensive evaluations on three distinctive datasets for two vision tasks. Compared to leading baselines, ECCO improves retraining accuracy by 6.7%-18.1% using the same compute and communication resources, or supports 3.3 times more concurrent cameras at the same accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "ECCO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5171\u4eab\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u5355\u72ec\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "ECCO\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u5206\u7ec4\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001GPU\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u5668\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cECCO\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u63d0\u53476.7%-18.1%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6216\u652f\u63013.3\u500d\u5e76\u53d1\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u3002", "conclusion": "ECCO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}
