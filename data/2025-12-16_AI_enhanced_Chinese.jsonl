However, this comes at the cost of increased memory access latency due to the need to rely on the network fabric to transfer data between remote nodes. As such, it is crucial to ascertain an application's memory latency sensitivity to minimize the overall performance impact. Existing tools for measuring memory latency sensitivity often rely on custom ad-hoc hardware or cycle-accurate simulators, which can be inflexible and time-consuming. To address this, we present EDAN (Execution DAG Analyzer), a novel performance analysis tool that leverages an application's runtime instruction trace to generate its corresponding execution DAG. This approach allows us to estimate the latency sensitivity of sequential programs and investigate the impact of different hardware configurations. EDAN not only provides us with the capability of calculating the theoretical bounds for performance metrics, but it also helps us gain insight into the memory-level parallelism inherent to HPC applications.

We apply this model to the OpenTelemetry Demo (\"Astronomy Shop\") using a GitHub Actions workflow that discovers the graph, runs simulations, and executes chaos experiments that randomly kill microservices in a Docker Compose deployment. Across the studied failure fractions, the model reproduces the overall availability degradation curve, while asynchronous semantics for Kafka edges change predicted availabilities by at most about 10^(-5) (0.001 percentage points).

However, precisely measuring the energy consumption of LLMs is often infeasible because hardware-based power monitors are not always accessible and software-based energy measurement tools are not accurate. While various prediction techniques have been developed to estimate LLM energy consumption, these approaches are limited to single-GPU environments and thus are not applicable to modern LLM inference which is typically parallelized across multiple GPUs. In this work, we remedy this gap and introduce PIE-P, a fine-grained energy prediction framework for multi-GPU inference, including tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism. Predicting the energy under parallelized inference is complicated by the non-determinism in inter-GPU communication, additional communication overheads, and difficulties in isolating energy during the communication/synchronization phase. We develop a scalable prediction framework that addresses these issues via precise sampling, fine-grained modeling of inter-GPU communication, and careful accounting of parallelization overhead.

Progress is further limited by the absence of standardised metrics and fidelity tolerances, preventing principled hardware-software co-design and rigorous exploration of quality-efficiency trade-offs. We introduce astroCAMP, a framework for guiding the co-design of next-generation imaging pipelines and sustainable HPC architectures that maximise scientific return within SKA's operational and environmental limits. astroCAMP provides: (1) a unified, extensible metric suite covering scientific fidelity, computational performance, sustainability, and lifecycle economics; (2) standardised SKA-representative datasets and reference outputs enabling reproducible benchmarking across CPUs, GPUs, and emerging accelerators; and (3) a multi-objective co-design formulation linking scientific-quality constraints to time-, energy-, carbon-to-solution, and total cost of ownership. We release datasets, benchmarking results, and a reproducibility kit, and evaluate co-design metrics for WSClean and IDG on an AMD EPYC 9334 processor and an NVIDIA H100 GPU. Further, we illustrate the use of astroCAMP for heterogeneous CPU-FPGA design-space exploration, and its potential to facilitate the identification of Pareto-optimal operating points for SKA-scale imaging deployments.

VC can be leveraged for rapid prototyping or developing the Minimum Viable Products (MVPs); however, it may introduce several risks throughout the software development life cycle. Based on our experience from several internally developed MVPs and a review of recent industry reports, this article analyzes the flow-debt tradeoffs associated with VC. The flow-debt trade-off arises when the seamless code generation occurs, leading to the accumulation of technical debt through architectural inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and increased maintenance overhead. These issues originate from process-level weaknesses, biases in model training data, a lack of explicit design rationale, and a tendency to prioritize quick code generation over human-driven iterative development.

These multi-agent architectures enable coordinated reasoning, planning, and execution across diverse domains, allowing agents to collaboratively automate complex workflows. Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment.

However, different applications place diverse and sometimes diverging demands on power, performance, and area that cannot be universally satisfied with fixed commodity DRAM designs. Die stacking creates the opportunity for a large DRAM design space through 3D integration and expanded total die area. To open and navigate this expansive design space of customized memory architectures that cater to application-specific needs, we introduce DreamRAM, a configurable bandwidth, capacity, energy, latency, and area modeling tool for custom 3D die-stacked DRAM designs. DreamRAM exposes fine-grained design customization parameters at the MAT, subarray, bank, and inter-bank levels, including extensions of partial page and subarray parallelism proposals found in the literature, to open a large previously-unexplored design space. DreamRAM analytically models wire pitch, width, length, capacitance, and scaling parameters to capture the performance tradeoffs of physical layout and routing design choices. Routing awareness enables DreamRAM to model a custom MAT-level routing scheme, Dataline-Over-MAT (DLOMAT), to facilitate better bandwidth tradeoffs. DreamRAM is calibrated and validated against published industry HBM3 and HBM2E designs. Within DreamRAM's rich design space, we identify designs that achieve each of 66% higher bandwidth, 100% higher capacity, and 45% lower power and energy per bit compared to the baseline design, each on an iso-bandwidth, iso-capacity, and iso-power basis.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamRAM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u76843D\u5806\u53e0DRAM\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u5bb9\u91cf\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9762\u79ef\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684DRAM\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u529f\u8017\u548c\u9762\u79ef\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "DreamRAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5728MAT\u3001\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u3001Bank\u7b49\u5c42\u7ea7\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5e03\u7ebf\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5982DLOMAT\u65b9\u6848\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u67903D\u5806\u53e0DRAM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0cDreamRAM\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e26\u5bbd\u63d0\u534766%\u3001\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ffb\u500d\u3001\u6bcf\u6bd4\u7279\u529f\u8017\u964d\u4f4e45%\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamRAM\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5236\u53163D\u5806\u53e0DRAM\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Across the case studies, the framework achieved high coverage and strong rationale alignment in both model and library recommendation tasks, performing comparably to generative AI assistants while offering superior traceability and consistency.\n  By framing AI model selection as an MCDM problem, this work establishes a rigorous foundation for transparent and reproducible decision support in research software engineering.

However, agent decisions can lead to persistent conflict loops, inefficient resource utilization, and degraded service performance. To overcome such challenges, we propose a novel framework for adaptive conflict resolution in resource-oriented orchestration using a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach. The framework enables handling resource conflicts across deployments and integrates a DRL model trained to mediate such conflicts based on real-time performance feedback and historical state information. The framework has been prototyped and validated on a Kubernetes-based testbed, illustrating its methodological feasibility and architectural resilience.

To address these challenges in the complex environment of roundabout intersections, this paper proposes a roundabout control algorithm, which takes into account the uncertainty of interactive information caused by time delays. First, to maintain the required distance between the current vehicle and its preceding and following vehicles, conflicting vehicles are identified based on the time-to-collision (TTC) in the conflict zone. To fully consider communication performance, a vehicle motion model incorporating time delays is established. According to the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) mechanism, the vehicle motion control that satisfies the roundabout constraints is determined. Second, by scheduling the sequence of vehicles entering the roundabout, a multiscale optimization objective is developed by integrating vehicle motion indicators and roundabout system indicators. Traffic density and travel time are embedded into the optimization problem to guide vehicles to enter the roundabout safely and stably. Through a variety of simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is verified by comparing its performance with that of multiple control algorithms under different autonomous vehicle penetration rates and heavy traffic load scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u73af\u5c9b\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4ea4\u901a\u4e0bCAV\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f71\u54cd\u8054\u7f51\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u73af\u5c9b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u5bf9\u65f6\u5ef6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u542b\u65f6\u5ef6\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eDMPC\u673a\u5236\u786e\u5b9a\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6574\u5408\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u8c03\u5ea6\u5165\u73af\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u901a\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bf9\u73af\u5c9bCAV\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing acceleration techniques such as prefetching or expert clustering often increase energy usage or reduce expert diversity. We present SliceMoE, an energy-efficient MoE inference framework for miss-rate-constrained deployment. SliceMoE introduces Dynamic Bit-Sliced Caching (DBSC), which caches experts at slice-level granularity and assigns precision on demand to expand effective expert capacity. To support mixed-precision experts without memory duplication, we propose Calibration-Free Asymmetric Matryoshka Quantization (AMAT), a truncation-based scheme that maintains compatibility between low-bit and high-bit slices. We further introduce Predictive Cache Warmup (PCW) to reduce early-decode cold misses by reshaping cache contents during prefill. Evaluated on DeepSeek-V2-Lite and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, SliceMoE reduces decode-stage energy consumption by up to 2.37x and 2.85x, respectively, and improves decode latency by up to 1.81x and 1.64x, while preserving near-high-bit accuracy.

In this article, we propose a framework that leverages LLM-based AI agents integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to enable intelligent and autonomous enforcement of security compliance. An initial case study demonstrates how an agent can assess configuration files for compliance with O-RAN Alliance and 3GPP standards, generate explainable justifications, and propose automated remediation if needed.

We focus on practical scenarios where the user workload in each cell is unknown and time-varying, and so are the effective capacities of the servers.

We formulate this problem as a stochastic bilevel optimization, which is strongly NP-hard and unseen in the literature. By approximating the objective function with submodular functions, we can utilize state-of-the-art greedy algorithms for submodular maximization to effectively solve our problem.

Pattern clustering is essential to reduce data complexity, yet existing methods struggle with computational prohibitiveness ($O(N^2)$ comparisons), sub-optimal discrete sampling for center alignment, and difficult speed-quality trade-offs. To address these, we propose an Optimal Alignment-Driven Iterative Closed-Loop Convergence Framework. First, to resolve alignment ambiguity, we introduce a hybrid suite of high-performance algorithms: an FFT-based Phase Correlation method for cosine similarity constraints, and a Robust Geometric Min-Max strategy for edge displacement constraints that analytically solves for the global optimum. Second, we model clustering as a Set Cover Problem (SCP) using a Surprisal-Based Lazy Greedy heuristic within a coarse-to-fine iterative refinement loop to ensure convergence. Additionally, a multi-stage pruning mechanism filters over 99% of redundant computations. Experimental results on the 2025 China Postgraduate EDA Elite Challenge benchmark demonstrate a 93.4% compression ratio relative to raw inputs and an over 100x speedup compared to the official baseline, effectively handling tens of thousands of patterns in seconds.

A multi-objective optimization framework is formulated to maximize the product of communication rate and range (PRR) while ensuring sensing performance and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) constraints. To solve this mixed-integer nonconvex problem, a two-dimensional grouped random search algorithm is developed, efficiently exploring subcarrier interleaved patterns and resource allocation schemes. Numerical simulations under real-world UWA channels demonstrate the designed system's superiority and effectiveness: our algorithm achieves 90% faster convergence than conventional exhaustive search with only a marginal 0.5 kbps km PRR degradation.

Yet, despite these benefits, practitioners often skip modeling because it is time-consuming and demands scarce expertise. We address this barrier by investigating whether open-weight large language models, adapted via instruction tuning, can generate high-quality BPMN process models directly from natural language descriptions in a cost-effective and privacy-preserving way. We introduce InstruBPM, a reproducible approach that prepares paired text-diagram data and instruction tunes an open source large language model with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and quantization for on-prem deployment. We evaluate the tuned model through complementary perspectives: (i) text/code similarity using BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR, (ii) structural fidelity using Relative Graph Edit Distance, (iii) guidelines conformance using external tool checks, and (iv) a small expert review. Using a curated subset of a multi-domain BPMN dataset, we compare the tuned model with untuned open-weight baselines and strong proprietary models under consistent prompting regimes. Our compact tuned model outperforms all baselines across sequence and structural metrics while requiring substantially fewer resources; guideline analysis and expert feedback further indicate that the generated diagrams largely follow BPMN best practices and are useful starting points that reduce modeling effort. Overall, instruction tuning improves structural accuracy and robustness compared to untuned baselines and reduces reliance on heavy prompt scaffolding.

Optimizing general matrix multiplication (GEMM) algorithms for these architectures is critical for improving DL workload performance. To this end, this paper presents a common systematic methodology to optimize GEMM workloads across the two current NPU generations, namely XDNA and XDNA2. Our implementations exploit the unique architectural features of AMD's NPUs and address key performance bottlenecks at the system level. End-to-end performance evaluation across various GEMM sizes demonstrates state-of-the-art throughput of up to 6.76 TOPS (XDNA) and 38.05 TOPS (XDNA2) for 8-bit integer (int8) precision. Similarly, for brain floating-point (bf16) precision, our GEMM implementations attain up to 3.14 TOPS (XDNA) and 14.71 TOPS (XDNA2).

The architecture consists of transceiver IQ skew estimation methods and a low-complexity MIMO equalizer structure. Before the IQ skew estimation, the chromatic dispersion(CD) is pre-compensated in the transmitter(TX) by chirp filtering. The receiver(RX) IQ skew is estimated by Gardner's phase detector, and the TX skew is estimated by finding the value that yields the lowest equalizer error. The low-complexity MIMO equalizer consists of a complex-valued MIMO(CV-MIMO) and a real-valued DD-LMS MIMO(RV-MIMO), which employ a butterfly and a non-butterfly structure, respectively. The CV-MIMO is used to perform polarization demultiplexing. The RV-MIMO equalizes each of the two polarisations and simultaneously compensates for the TX IQ imbalance. The architecture first compensates for the IQ skew at low-complexity, and the other imperfections are compensated by the low-complexity MIMO equalizer. Therefore, this architecture can equalize signals impaired by the transceiver IQ imbalance with low complexity. A 100 km transmission simulation and experiment with 36 Gbaud dual-polarization quadrature amplitude modulation(DP-QAM) signals and offline DSP showed that, with the RX IQ skew estimation, the number of real multiplications is reduced by more than 70% compared with conventional cases. With the low-complexity MIMO equalizer, the number of real multiplications is reduced by 51% compared with 4x4 MIMO", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6IQ\u5931\u8861\u8865\u507f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u8865\u507f\u6536\u53d1\u5668IQ\u5931\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u964d\u4f4eIQ\u5931\u8861\u8865\u507f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d1\u5c04\u7aef\u8272\u6563\u9884\u8865\u507f\u3001Gardner\u76f8\u4f4d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a5\u6536\u7aefIQ\u504f\u659c\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u8861\u8bef\u5dee\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u53d1\u5c04\u7aef\u504f\u659c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u590d\u503c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u503cMIMO\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u6781\u5316\u89e3\u590d\u7528\u4e0e\u5931\u8861\u8865\u507f\u3002", "result": "\u5728100\u516c\u91cc36 Gbaud DP-QAM\u4f20\u8f93\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a5\u6536\u7aefIQ\u504f\u659c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f7f\u5b9e\u6570\u4e58\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8570%\uff0c\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6MIMO\u5747\u8861\u5668\u4f7f\u4e58\u6cd5\u8fd0\u7b97\u51cf\u5c1151%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u6548\u8865\u507f\u6536\u53d1\u5668IQ\u5931\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901f\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, LLM hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect citations to source code, remains a critical barrier to reliable developer assistance. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving verifiable, citation grounded code comprehension through hybrid retrieval and lightweight structural reasoning. Our work is grounded in systematic evaluation across 30 Python repositories with 180 developer queries, comparing retrieval modalities, graph expansion strategies, and citation verification mechanisms. We find that challenges of citation accuracy arise from the interplay between sparse lexical matching, dense semantic similarity, and cross file architectural dependencies. Among these, cross file evidence discovery is the largest contributor to citation completeness, but it is largely overlooked because existing systems rely on pure textual similarity without leveraging code structure. We advocate for citation grounded generation as an architectural principle for code comprehension systems and demonstrate this need by achieving 92 percent citation accuracy with zero hallucinations. Specifically, we develop a hybrid retrieval system combining BM25 sparse matching, BGE dense embeddings, and Neo4j graph expansion via import relationships, which outperforms single mode baselines by 14 to 18 percentage points while discovering cross file evidence missed by pure text similarity in 62 percent of architectural queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u5f15\u7528\u63a5\u5730\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f15\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u56e0\u5e7b\u89c9\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u5f15\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u67e5\u8be2\u964c\u751f\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u65f6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u878d\u5408BM25\u7a00\u758f\u5339\u914d\u3001BGE\u7a20\u5bc6\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eNeo4j\u5bfc\u5165\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6587\u4ef6\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u8bc1\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u572830\u4e2aPython\u4ed3\u5e93180\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523092%\u5f15\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e14\u96f6\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534714-18\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c62%\u67b6\u6784\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u4ef6\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u7528\u63a5\u5730\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

We improve gem5, an open-source simulator with over 1600 forks, and gem5 Resources, a centralized repository of over 2000 pre-packaged artifacts, to address these issues. While gem5 Resources enables artifact sharing, researchers still face challenges. Creating custom disk images is complex and time-consuming, with no standardized process across ISAs, making it difficult to extend and share images. gem5 provides limited guest-host communication features through a set of predefined exit events that restrict researchers' ability to dynamically control and monitor simulations. Lastly, running simulations with multiple workloads requires researchers to write custom external scripts to coordinate multiple gem5 simulations which creates error-prone and hard-to-reproduce workflows. To overcome this, we introduce several features in gem5 and gem5 Resources. We standardize disk-image creation across x86, ARM, and RISC-V using Packer, and provide validated base images with pre-annotated benchmark suites (NPB, GAPBS). We provide 12 new disk images, 6 new kernels, and over 200 workloads across three ISAs. We refactor the exit event system to a class-based model and introduce hypercalls for enhanced guest-host communication that allows researchers to define custom behavior for their exit events. We also provide a utility to remotely monitor simulations and the gem5-bridge driver for user-space m5 operations. Additionally, we implemented Suites and MultiSim to enable parallel full-system simulations from gem5 configuration scripts, eliminating the need for external scripting.

However, existing LLM serving schedulers fail to jointly optimize for both SLO attainment and client-level priorities.\n  To bridge this gap, we first \\textit{formalize multi-priority request scheduling as a service gain maximization problem}, where satisfying latency requirements for requests of different priorities contributes varying levels of gain. We then propose PROSERVE, a unified two-tier scheduling framework designed to maximize overall service gain. At the engine level, SlideBatching dynamically adapts batch formation and request ordering under varying load conditions, employing a sliding boundary mechanism to balance deadline-first and density-first strategies.

Eisty"], "title": "The Role of AI in Modern Penetration Testing", "comment": null, "summary": "Penetration testing is a cornerstone of cybersecurity, traditionally driven by manual, time-intensive processes. As systems grow in complexity, there is a pressing need for more scalable and efficient testing methodologies. This systematic literature review examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping penetration testing, analyzing 58 peer-reviewed studies from major academic databases. Our findings reveal that while AI-assisted pentesting is still in its early stages, notable progress is underway, particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL), which was the focus of 77% of the reviewed works. Most research centers on the discovery and exploitation phases of pentesting, where AI shows the greatest promise in automating repetitive tasks, optimizing attack strategies, and improving vulnerability identification. Real-world applications remain limited but encouraging, including the European Space Agency's PenBox and various open-source tools. These demonstrate AI's potential to streamline attack path analysis, analyze complex network topology, and reduce manual workload. However, challenges persist: current models often lack flexibility and are underdeveloped for the reconnaissance and post-exploitation phases of pentesting. Applications involving Large Language Models (LLMs) remain relatively under-researched, pointing to a promising direction for future exploration.

While machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, their effectiveness is limited by the way they interpret data. Unlike natural language, source code meaning is defined less by token adjacency and more by complex, long-range, and structural relationships and dependencies. This limitation is especially pronounced for C and C++, where flatter syntactic hierarchies, pointer aliasing, multi-level indirection, typedef-based type obfuscation, and function-pointer calls hinder accurate static analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ATLAS, a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) that (i) generates statement-level Control Flow Graphs (CFG) and type-aware Data Flow Graphs (DFG) that capture inter-functional dependencies for the entire program; (ii) has the ability to work on entire C and C++ projects comprising multiple files; (iii) works on both compilable and non-compilable code and (iv) produces a unified multi-view code representation using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), CFG and DFG. By preserving essential structural and semantic information, ATLAS provides a practical foundation for improving downstream SE and machine-learning-based program understanding.

The MAP estimation problem is reformulated as a continuous-time optimal control problem based on the Onsager-Machlup functional. This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother.

However, enabling large-scale training on early-life AI accelerators faces three core challenges: frequent system disruptions and undefined failure modes that undermine reliability; numerical errors and training instabilities that threaten correctness and convergence; and the complexity of parallelism optimization combined with unpredictable local noise that degrades efficiency. To address these challenges, SIGMA is an open-source training stack designed to improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of large-scale distributed training on early-life AI hardware. The core of this initiative is the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP), the system optimized for clusters with early-life AI accelerators. Since its launch in March 2025, LTP has significantly enhanced training reliability and operational productivity. Over the past five months, it has achieved an impressive 94.45% effective cluster accelerator utilization, while also substantially reducing node recycling and job-recovery times. Building on the foundation of LTP, the LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) successfully trained SIGMA-MOE, a 200B MoE model, using 2,048 AI accelerators.

However, this growth is accompanied by increased attention from malicious actors, resulting in a significant rise in security threats to the Android ecosystem. Among these threats, the adoption of Anti-Runtime Analysis (ARA) techniques by malicious applications poses a serious challenge, as it hinders security professionals from effectively analyzing malicious behaviors using dynamic analysis tools. ARA technologies are designed to prevent the dynamic examination of applications, thus complicating efforts to ensure platform security. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study that assesses the ability of widely-used Android dynamic analysis tools to bypass various ARA techniques. Our findings reveal a critical gap in the effectiveness of existing dynamic analysis tools to counter ARA mechanisms, highlighting an urgent need for more robust solutions.

Existing solutions often deploy the entire model as a single monolithic unit, which applies a unified resource configuration to both attention and expert modules despite their different requirements, leading to limited scalability and resource inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Janus, a scalable MoE inference system that disaggregates attention and experts on separate GPU sub-clusters, enabling each module to be managed and scaled independently. Janus incorporates three key designs for efficient, disaggregated MoE inference. First, it proposes an adaptive two-phase communication scheme that exploits intra- and inter-node bandwidth hierarchies for low-latency data exchange. Second, motivated by the memory-bound nature of MoE modules, Janus introduces a lightweight scheduler and implements it as a GPU kernel to balance the number of activated experts across GPUs at minimal overhead, thereby reducing inference latency. Third, Janus performs fine-grained resource management to dynamically adjust expert placement and independently scale attention and MoE resources to improve overall efficiency. Evaluation shows Janus achieves up to 3.9 higher perGPU throughput than state-of-the-art systems while meeting per-token latency requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Janus \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684 MoE \u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u79bb\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u4e0d\u540c GPU \u5b50\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u56e0\u7edf\u4e00\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4 MoE \u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5185\u6838\u53ca\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e Janus \u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bcf GPU \u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347 3.9 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Janus \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 MoE \u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

In this study, we aim to provide an encompassing analysis of higher education on software engineering by considering the higher educational offering of an entire European country, namely the Netherlands. We leverage a crowd-sourced analysis process by considering 10 Dutch universities and 207 university courses. The courses are analysed via knowledge areas adopted from the SWEBOK. The mapping process is refined via homogenisation and internal consistency improvement phases, and is followed by a data analysis phase. Given its fundamental nature, Construction and Programming is the most covered knowledge area at Bachelor level. Other knowledge areas are equally covered at Bachelor and Master level (e.g., software engineering models), while more advanced ones are almost exclusively covered at Master level. We identify three clusters of tightly coupled knowledge areas: (i) requirements, architecture, and design, (ii) testing, verification, and security, and (iii) process-oriented and DevOps topics. Dutch universities generally cover all knowledge areas uniformly, with minor deviations reflecting institutional research strengths. Our results highlight correlations among key knowledge areas and their potential for enhancing integrated learning.

[Method] We conducted a workshop with 42 senior SE researchers during the ISERN 2024 meeting. The seven attributes were presented using a Problem Vision board filled with a research example. Participants discussed attributes in groups, shared written feedback, and individually completed a survey assessing their importance, completeness, and suggestions for improvement. [Results] The findings confirm the importance of the seven attributes in the formulation of industry-oriented research problems. Qualitative feedback illustrated how they can be applied in practice and revealed suggestions to refine them, such as incorporating financial criteria (e.g., ROI) into implications/impacts and addressing feasibility and constraints under evidence.

The fault detection effectiveness of MT is influenced not only by the choice and quality of MRs, but also by how source test cases and metamorphic groups (MGs) are selected. While substantial research has focused on designing, generating, and validating MRs, systematic methods for source test case selection and MG selection remain largely unexplored. Although the Proportional Sampling Strategy (PSS) provides strong theoretical guarantees in traditional testing, its assumptions cannot be directly applied in MT due to differences in selection domains, test units, and failure distributions. This paper proposes PSALM, an adaptation of PSS to MT for both source test case selection and MG selection. We formally prove that PSALM is never inferior to random selection regardless of how the source test case and MG domains are partitioned. We further identify the conditions under which applying PSALM to source test case selection and MG selection yields identical effectiveness. A comprehensive empirical study on eight subject programs and 184 mutants shows that the results are consistent with our theoretical analysis and that PSALM generally performs more effectively than existing selection strategies such as ART and MT-ART.

These characteristics make it especially challenging to monitor the execution of quantum circuits, complicating essential tasks such as debugging and runtime monitoring. This paper presents QMON, a practical methodology that leverages mid-circuit measurements and reset operations to monitor the internal states of quantum circuits while preserving their original runtime behavior. QMON enables the instrumentation of monitoring operators at developer-specified locations within the circuit, allowing comparisons between expected and observed quantum-state probabilities at those locations. We evaluated QMON by analyzing its impact on circuit behavior, monitoring coverage, and effectiveness in bug localization. Experimental results involving 154 quantum circuits show that all circuits preserve their intended functionality after instrumentation and that QMON successfully detects and localizes various programming errors. Although monitoring coverage is limited by the need to preserve delicate quantum properties, such as entanglement, QMON effectively detects errors while introducing no or negligible disturbance to the original quantum states.

Existing work in requirements engineering (RE) has explored how requirements for AI systems and their data can be represented. However, related interviews with industry professionals show that data annotations and their related requirements introduce distinct challenges, indicating a need for annotation-specific requirement representations. We propose the Data Annotation Requirements Representation and Specification (DARS), including an Annotation Negotiation Card to align stakeholders on objectives and constraints, and a Scenario-Based Annotation Specification to express atomic and verifiable data annotation requirements. We evaluate DARS with an automotive perception case related to an ongoing project, and a mapping against 18 real-world data annotation error types. The results suggest that DARS mitigates root causes of completeness, accuracy, and consistency annotation errors. By integrating DARS into RE, this work improves the reliability of safety-critical systems using data annotations and demonstrates how engineering frameworks must evolve for data-dependent components of today's intelligent information systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDARS\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u7279\u6709\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1DARS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6ce8\u91ca\u534f\u5546\u5361\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6c7d\u8f66\u611f\u77e5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e0e18\u7c7b\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u6620\u5c04\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "DARS\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06DARS\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u53ef\u63a8\u52a8\u9762\u5411\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002"}}

The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316SQL\u4ee3\u7801\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eceOracle PL/SQL\u5230PostgreSQL\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u4e13\u5bb6\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u8fc1\u79fb\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u529f\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5d4c\u5165\u8fc1\u79fb\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u6620\u5c04\u4e0e\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ea0\u9519\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8f6c\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
