Although automating scientific tasks with large language models (LLMs) has attracted attention, applying them to the complete, end-to-end CFD workflow remains a challenge due to its stringent domain-specific requirements. We introduce CFD-copilot, a domain-specialized LLM framework designed to facilitate natural language-driven CFD simulation from setup to post-processing. The framework employs a fine-tuned LLM to directly translate user descriptions into executable CFD setups. A multi-agent system integrates the LLM with simulation execution, automatic error correction, and result analysis. For post-processing, the framework utilizes the model context protocol (MCP), an open standard that decouples LLM reasoning from external tool execution. This modular design allows the LLM to interact with numerous specialized post-processing functions through a unified and scalable interface, improving the automation of data extraction and analysis. The framework was evaluated on benchmarks including the NACA~0012 airfoil and the three-element 30P-30N airfoil. The results indicate that domain-specific adaptation and the incorporation of the MCP jointly enhance the reliability and efficiency of LLM-driven engineering workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "CFD-copilot \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53 LLM \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u5230\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u964d\u4f4e\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4f7f\u7528 CFD \u4eff\u771f\u7684\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5fae\u8c03 LLM + \u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf + MCP \u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u4eff\u771f\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u81ea\u7ea0\u4e0e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728 NACA~0012 \u4e0e 30P-30N \u7ffc\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u4e0e MCP \u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528 LLM \u4e0e\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u52a8\u5de5\u7a0b\u4eff\u771f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002"}}

Yet, the nondeterministic and run-time-defined semantics of ML complicate traditional software refactoring. We define semantic preservation in LESS as the property that optimizations of intelligent components do not alter the system's overall functional behavior. This paper introduces an empirical framework to evaluate semantic preservation in LESS by mining model evolution data from HuggingFace. We extract commit histories, $\\textit{Model Cards}$, and performance metrics from a large number of models. To establish baselines, we conducted case studies in three domains, tracing performance changes across versions. Our analysis demonstrates how $\\textit{semantic drift}$ can be detected via evaluation metrics across commits and reveals common refactoring patterns based on commit message analysis. Although API constraints limited the possibility of estimating a full-scale threshold, our pipeline offers a foundation for defining community-accepted boundaries for semantic preservation. Our contributions include: (1) a large-scale dataset of ML model evolution, curated from 1.7 million Hugging Face entries via a reproducible pipeline using the native HF hub API, (2) a practical pipeline for the evaluation of semantic preservation for a subset of 536 models and 4000+ metrics and (3) empirical case studies illustrating semantic drift in practice.

Our gray literature investigation shows various definitions of fairness requirements in AI systems, commonly emphasizing non-discrimination and equal treatment across different demographic and social attributes. Fairness requirement management practices vary across the SDLC, particularly in model training and bias mitigation, fairness monitoring and evaluation, and data handling practices. Fairness requirement violations are frequently linked, but not limited, to data representation bias, algorithmic and model design bias, human judgment, and evaluation and transparency gaps. The corresponding consequences include harm in a broad sense, encompassing specific professional and societal impacts as key examples, stereotype reinforcement, data and privacy risks, and loss of trust and legitimacy in AI-supported decisions.

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired computing paradigm that encodes input features into low-precision, high-dimensional vectors with simple element-wise operations, making it well-suited for resource-constrained edge platforms. Recent work enhances HDC accuracy for graph classification via Nystr\u00f6m kernel approximations. Edge acceleration of such methods faces several challenges: (i) redundancy among (landmark) samples selected via uniform sampling, (ii) storing the Nystr\u00f6m projection matrix under limited on-chip memory, (iii) expensive, contention-prone codebook lookups, and (iv) load imbalance due to irregular sparsity in SpMV. To address these challenges, we propose NysX, the first end-to-end FPGA accelerator for Nystr\u00f6m-based HDC graph classification at the edge. NysX integrates four key optimizations: (i) a hybrid landmark selection strategy combining uniform sampling with determinantal point processes (DPPs) to reduce redundancy while improving accuracy; (ii) a streaming architecture for Nystr\u00f6m projection matrix maximizing external memory bandwidth utilization; (iii) a minimal-perfect-hash lookup engine enabling $O(1)$ key-to-index mapping with low on-chip memory overhead; and (iv) sparsity-aware SpMV engines with static load balancing.

While most are deployed in single node setups, CXL.mem is a technology that implements memories that can be attached to multiple nodes simultaneously, enabling shared memory pooling. This opens new possibilities, particularly for efficient inter-node communication.\n  In this paper, we present a novel performance evaluation toolchain combined with an extended performance model for message-based communication, which can be used to predict potential performance benefits from using CXL.mem for data exchange. Our approach analyzes data access patterns of MPI applications: it analyzes on-node accesses to/from MPI buffers, as well as cross-node MPI traffic to gather a full understanding of the impact of memory performance. We combine this data in an extended performance model to predict which data transfers could benefit from direct CXL.mem implementations as compared to traditional MPI messages. Our model works on a per-MPI call granularity, allowing the identification and later optimizations of those MPI invocations in the code with the highest potential for speedup by using CXL.mem.\n  For our toolchain, we extend the memory trace sampling tool Mitos and use it to extract data access behavior. In the post-processing step, the raw data is automatically analyzed to provide performance models for each individual MPI call. We validate the models on two sample applications -- a 2D heat transfer miniapp and the HPCG benchmark -- and use them to demonstrate their support for targeted optimizations by integrating CXL.mem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30CXL.mem\u5728MPI\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5899\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22CXL.mem\u5728\u8de8\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Mitos\u5de5\u5177\u91c7\u96c6MPI\u5e94\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4bCXL.mem\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfMPI\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfcminiapp\u548cHPCG\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684MPI\u8c03\u7528\u5e76\u5c55\u793aCXL.mem\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u9488\u5bf9CXL.mem\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u6784\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\u4e0bHPC\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To achieve this goal, we adopt a probabilistic framework and consider a performance as a probability measure (e.g., a normalized confusion matrix for a classification task). It appears that the corresponding weighted mean is known to be the summarization, and that only some remarkable scores assign to the summarized performance a value equal to a weighted arithmetic mean of the values assigned to the domain-specific performances. These scores include the family of ranking scores, a continuum parameterized by user preferences, and that the weights to consider in the arithmetic mean depend on the user preferences. Based on this, we rigorously define four domains, named easiest, most difficult, preponderant, and bottleneck domains, as functions of user preferences.

NecoFuzz synthesizes executable fuzz-harness VMs with internal states near the boundary between valid and invalid, guided by an approximate model of hardware-assisted virtualization specifications.

The MARINE refinement operator systematically converts a base model's pass@N capabilities into near-optimal pass@1 performance. Rigorous theoretical analysis establishes that minimal feasible batches maximize expected performance gains under fixed invocation budgets, while logarithmically growing batch schedules ensure continuous improvement without computational constraints. Comprehensive evaluation on the BrowserComp-ZH benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art results, with a 685B-parameter implementation achieving 46.0% pass@1 accuracy. Meanwhile, MARINE establishes a new paradigm for parameter-efficient reasoning: an 80B-parameter model augmented with MARINE matches the performance of standalone 1000B-parameter agents, reducing parameter requirements by over an order of magnitude. Notably, within a fixed computational budget, the proposed MARINE delivers higher-quality samples to alignment and optimization processes than traditional sampling-and-ranking strategies. Consequently, it has great potential to boost post-training efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "MARINE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u8f93\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u6b21\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMARINE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5bf9\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u5c0f\u6279\u6b21\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6570\u589e\u957f\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728BrowserComp-ZH\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c685B\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe46.0% pass@1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b80B\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e1000B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u5341\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "MARINE\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b97\u529b\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u91c7\u6837\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce Chopper, a profiling and analysis framework that collects, aligns, and visualizes GPU kernel traces and hardware performance counters across multiple granularities (i.e., from individual kernels to operations, layers, phases, iterations, and GPUs). Using Chopper, we perform a comprehensive end-to-end characterization of Llama 3 8B training under fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP) on an eight-GPU AMD InstinctTM MI300X node. Our analysis reveals several previously underexplored bottlenecks and behaviors, such as memory determinism enabling higher, more stable GPU and memory frequencies. We identify several sources of inefficiencies, with frequency overhead (DVFS effects) being the single largest contributor to the gap between theoretical and observed performance, exceeding the impact of MFMA utilization loss, communication/computation overlap, and kernel launch overheads.

Finally, the client component, which manifests as a POSIX-compliant filesystem, is adaptable and operational across many architectures.

Investigating Package Hallucinations of Shell Command in Original and Quantized LLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models for code (LLMs4Code) are increasingly used to generate software artifacts, including library and package recommendations in languages such as Go. However, recent evidence shows that LLMs frequently hallucinate package names or generate dependencies containing known security vulnerabilities, posing significant risks to developers and downstream software supply chains. At the same time, quantization has become a widely adopted technique to reduce inference cost and enable deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained environments. Despite its popularity, little is known about how quantization affects the correctness and security of LLM-generated software dependencies while generating shell commands for package installation.\n  In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study of the impact of quantization on package hallucination and vulnerability risks in LLM-generated Go packages. We evaluate five Qwen model sizes under full-precision, 8-bit, and 4-bit quantization across three datasets (SO, MBPP, and paraphrase). Our results show that quantization substantially increases the package hallucination rate (PHR), with 4-bit models exhibiting the most severe degradation. We further find that even among the correctly generated packages, the vulnerability presence rate (VPR) rises as precision decreases, indicating elevated security risk in lower-precision models. Finally, our analysis of hallucinated outputs reveals that most fabricated packages resemble realistic URL-based Go module paths, such as most commonly malformed or non-existent GitHub and golang.org repositories, highlighting a systematic pattern in how LLMs hallucinate dependencies.

However, the inherent uncertainty of aircraft trajectories and traffic flows poses significant challenges to both prediction accuracy and trustworthiness. Therefore, prediction models should not only provide point estimates of aircraft landing times but also the uncertainties associated with these predictions. Furthermore, aircraft trajectories are frequently influenced by the presence of nearby aircraft through air traffic control interventions such as radar vectoring. Consequently, landing time prediction models must account for multi-agent interactions in the airspace. In this work, we propose a probabilistic multi-agent aircraft landing time prediction framework that provides the landing times of multiple aircraft as distributions. We evaluate the proposed framework using an air traffic surveillance dataset collected from the terminal airspace of the Incheon International Airport in South Korea.

This paper reports our experience converting the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) from Qiskit Algorithms with Qiskit 1.x (v1 primitives) to a custom implementation using Qiskit 2.x (v2 primitives). Despite identical circuits, optimizers, and Hamiltonians, the new version produced drastically different results. A systematic analysis revealed the root cause: the sampling budget -- the number of circuit executions (shots) per iteration.

One important factor is the inherent verbosity of programming languages, such as unnecessary formatting elements and lengthy boilerplate code. This leads to inflated token counts in both input and generated outputs, which increases inference costs and slows down the generation process. Prior work improves this through simplifying programming language grammar, reducing token usage across both code understanding and generation tasks. However, it is confined to syntactic transformations, leaving significant opportunities for token reduction unrealized at the semantic level.\n  In this work, we propose Token Sugar, a concept that replaces frequent and verbose code patterns with reversible, token-efficient shorthand in the source code. To realize this concept in practice, we designed a systematic solution that mines high-frequency, token-heavy patterns from a code corpus, maps each to a unique shorthand, and integrates them into LLM pretraining via code transformation. With this solution, we obtain 799 (code pattern, shorthand) pairs, which can reduce up to 15.1% token count in the source code and is complementary to existing syntax-focused methods. We further trained three widely used LLMs on Token Sugar-augmented data.

Extending this line of research, the present study proposes high-performance emulation methods for single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication on INT8 matrix engines, based on the Ozaki-II scheme. On an NVIDIA B200 GPU, the proposed methods achieve 4.0x--5.6x and 4.4x--6.5x speedups over the native single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication routines from cuBLAS, respectively, for sufficiently large problem sizes. When lower accuracy than that of the standard routine is acceptable, the proposed methods can operate at even higher speed.

Traditional caching policies, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU), perform well under specific request patterns. LRU excels in workloads with strong temporal locality, while LFU is effective when content popularity remains static. However, real-world client requests often exhibit correlations due to shared contexts and coordinated activities. This is particularly evident in Virtual Reality (VR) environments, where groups of clients navigate shared virtual spaces, leading to correlated content requests.\n  In this paper, we introduce the \\textit{grouped client request model}, a generalization of the Independent Reference Model that explicitly captures different types of request correlations. Our theoretical analysis of LRU under this model reveals that the optimal causal caching policy depends on cache size: LFU is optimal for small to moderate caches, while LRU outperforms it for larger caches. To address the limitations of existing policies, we propose Least Following and Recently Used (LFRU), a novel online caching policy that dynamically infers and adapts to causal relationships in client requests to optimize evictions. LFRU prioritizes objects likely to be requested based on inferred dependencies, achieving near-optimal performance compared to the offline optimal Belady policy in structured correlation settings.\n  We develop VR based datasets to evaluate caching policies under realistic correlated requests.

These inefficiencies arise in widely used ML frameworks and applications, yet developers often lack the visibility and tools to detect and diagnose them.\n  We propose differential energy debugging, a novel approach that leverages the observation that competing ML systems often implement similar functionality with vastly different energy consumption. Building on this insight, we design and implement Magneton, an energy profiler that compares energy consumption between similar ML systems at the operator level and automatically pinpoints code regions and configuration choices responsible for excessive energy use.

However, implementations for access by programmable alternatives known as lightweight threads (also referred to as asynchronous calls or coroutines) have not been thoroughly studied. The main advantage of lightweight threads is their significantly lower overhead during launch and context switching. However, this comes at a cost: to achieve proper parallelism, context switches must be manually invoked in the code; without these switches, new lightweight threads will never be executed.\n  In this paper, we focus on the simplest multithreaded data structure: a mutex (also known as a lock). We demonstrate that original implementations for OS threads cannot be used effectively in this new context due to the potential for deadlocks. Furthermore, correctness is not the only concern. In certain languages, such as C++, there are various lightweight thread libraries, each with different implementations and interfaces, which necessitate distinct lock implementations.\n  In this work, we present a modification of TTAS and MCS locks for the use from lightweight threads and demonstrate that the two context switch mechanisms of lightweight threads, yielding and sleeping, are crucial. However, the performance of TTAS and MCS may differ significantly depending on the settings.

A key limitation in existing research is the failure to distinguish between agreement with the abstract, high-level values of the Agile Manifesto and agreement with the concrete, day-to-day practices derived from the 12 Principles. This paper addresses this methodological gap by presenting the design and validation of two distinct instruments: the novel Manifesto Agreement Scale (MAS), and the Principle Agreement Scale (PAS), which is a systematic adaptation and refinement of a prior instrument.\n  We detail the systematic process of item creation and selection, survey design, and validation. The results demonstrate that both scales possess important internal consistency and construct validity. A convergence and divergence analysis, including Proportional Odds Logistic Regression, a Bland-Altman plot, and an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), reveals that while the two scales are moderately correlated, they are not interchangeable and capture distinct dimensions of agile agreement. The primary contribution of this work is a pair of publicly available instruments, validated within a specific demographic of Belgian IT professionals. These scales represent a critical initial step toward facilitating a more nuanced measurement of agile agreement, distinguishing agile agreement across various levels of perception and aiding in a more refined interpretation of person-agile fit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d4b\u91cf\u654f\u6377\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u91cf\u8868\uff1a\u5ba3\u8a00\u534f\u8bae\u91cf\u8868\uff08MAS\uff09\u548c\u539f\u5219\u534f\u8bae\u91cf\u8868\uff08PAS\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u654f\u6377\u5ba3\u8a00\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e0e12\u9879\u539f\u5219\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u8ba4\u540c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u654f\u6377\u5ba3\u8a00\u62bd\u8c61\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u8df5\u539f\u5219\u7684\u8ba4\u540c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u6761\u76ee\u521b\u5efa\u3001\u95ee\u5377\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u3001\u5efa\u6784\u6548\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u6536\u655b\u53d1\u6563\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4f18\u52bf\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001Bland-Altman\u56fe\u3001\u7ec4\u5185\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u8868\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "MAS\u4e0ePAS\u5747\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u4fe1\u6548\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u4e2d\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u4e0d\u53ef\u4e92\u6362\uff0c\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u654f\u6377\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5bf9\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u8868\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e0e\u654f\u6377\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u654f\u6377\u4eba\u56e0\u7814\u7a76\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u3002"}}

Grounded in the person-object theory of interest (POI), we conceptualize enthusiasm as a short-term, activating expression of interest that combines positive affect, perceived relevance, and intention to re-engage. Experiencing such enthusiasm can temporarily shift CS attitudes and strengthen future engagement intentions, making it a valuable lens for evaluating brief outreach activities. To capture these dynamics, we developed a theoretically grounded questionnaire for pre-post assessment of the enthusiasm potential of CS interventions. Using data from more than 400 students participating in online CS courses, we examined age- and gender-related patterns in enthusiasm. The findings challenge the prevailing belief that early exposure is the primary pathway to sustained interest in CS. Instead, we identify a marked decline in enthusiasm during early adolescence, particularly among girls, alongside substantial variability in interest trajectories across age groups. Crucially, our analyses reveal that age is a more decisive factor than gender in shaping interest development and uncover key developmental breakpoints. Despite starting with lower baseline attitudes, older students showed the largest positive changes following the intervention, suggesting that well-designed short activities can effectively re-activate interest even at later ages. Overall, the study highlights the need for a dynamic, age-sensitive framework for CS education in which instructional strategies are aligned with developmental trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u654f\u611f\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5e74\u9f84\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba-\u7269\u5174\u8da3\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u5377\u8bc4\u4f30\u77ed\u671f\u5e72\u9884\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u5174\u8da3\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790400\u591a\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5e74\u9f84\u6bd4\u6027\u522b\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5174\u8da3\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5973\u751f\u5174\u8da3\u660e\u663e\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u5e74\u957f\u5b66\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u540e\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u4f9d\u636e\u53d1\u5c55\u9636\u6bb5\u8c03\u6574\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u4f18\u8d28\u6d3b\u52a8\u53ef\u5728\u8f83\u665a\u5e74\u9f84\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u71c3\u5b66\u4e60\u5174\u8da3\u3002"}}

Our simulation results indicate that spatial shifting can substantially lower carbon, water, and land use footprints, with observed reductions ranging from 20% to 85%, depending on the scenario and optimization criteria. Temporal shifting also decreases the footprint, though to a lesser extent.

Visual prototypes representing each element were developed, and a best-worst scaling (BWS) survey with 125 participants was administered to elicit preference rankings. Qualitative feedback was also collected to uncover motivational drivers. Learners consistently preferred GDEs that support learning processes directly-most notably progress bars, concept maps, immediate feedback, and achievements. Qualitative analysis revealed six recurring motivational themes, including visible progress, content relevance, and constructive feedback.

The results indicate that RESTifAI performs on par with the latest LLM tools, i.e., AutoRestTest and LogiAgent, while addressing limitations related to reusability, oracle complexity, and integration.

We study four multicalibration approaches on three function synthesis benchmarks, using latest-generation code LLMs (Qwen3 Coder, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1-Distill).

To investigate its importance and to what extent it has been explored, we analyze real user-LLM dialogues from WildChat and find that: (1) The Dev Knowledge QA task accounts for 39.6% of interactions(highest among all tasks), revealing broad knowledge needs beyond code generation (32.3%). (2) Only 27.5% of real Dev Knowledge QA dialogues focus on code understanding, leaving out development knowledge-seeking. (3) Only 17.1% of real-world Dev Knowledge QA dialogues can be used for constructing a benchmark. Existing benchmarks have two primary limitations for evaluating the Dev Knowledge QA capability of LLMs. First, existing benchmarks offer a limited development knowledge scope, mainly focusing on code understanding and neglecting broader knowledge during development. Second, some benchmarks are not built from real user queries. To bridge this gap, we design a three-phase pipeline that transforms real-world dialogue into simple development knowledge-seeking QA pairs. Through this pipeline, we introduce SimpleDevQA, a multilingual benchmark derived from real user dialogues. It contains 2,740 QA pairs in three languages (English, Chinese, and Russian), and focuses on questions with unique, short, and verifiable answers for accurate and simple evaluation. Experiments show that: Code LLMs generally outperform general LLMs of similar scale; Knowledge injection with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy can boost LLM accuracy by 11.3% on average; LLMs show systematic overconfidence in Dev Knowledge QA, and the answering accuracy of LLMs shows a positive correlation with their stated confidence; Generally, LLMs with stronger code generation performance also exhibit stronger performance in Dev Knowledge QA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSimpleDevQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801LLM\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528LLM\uff0cRAG\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u57fa\u51c6SimpleDevQA\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4ee3\u7801LLM\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528LLM\uff0cRAG\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534711.3%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14LLM\u81ea\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u8d34\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Gelman and Loken refer to this freedom as leading to a \"garden of forking paths\". Although this freedom is often seen as an advantage, it also poses a threat to robustness and replicability: variations in analytical decisions, even when justifiable, can lead to divergent conclusions.\n  To better understand this risk, we conducted a so-called multiverse analysis on a published empirical SE paper. The paper we picked is a Mining Software Repositories study, as MSR studies commonly use non-trivial statistical models to analyze post-hoc, observational data. In the study, we identified nine pivotal analytical decisions-each with at least one equally defensible alternative and systematically reran all the 3,072 resulting analysis pipelines on the original dataset. Interestingly, only 6 of these universes (<0.2%) reproduced the published results; the overwhelming majority produced qualitatively different, and sometimes even opposite, findings.\n  This case study of a data analytical method commonly applied to empirical software engineering data reveals how methodological choices can exert a more profound influence on outcomes than is often acknowledged. We therefore advocate that SE researchers complement standard reporting with robustness checks across plausible analysis variants or, at least, explicitly justify each analytical decision. We propose a structured classification model to help classify and improve justification for methodological choices. Secondly, we show how the multiverse analysis is a practical tool in the methodological arsenal of SE researchers, one that can help produce more reliable, reproducible science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5b87\u5b99\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u51b3\u7b56\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u6216\u660e\u786e\u8bba\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u7531\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e00\u7bc7\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684MSR\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5b87\u5b99\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd53072\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4e0d\u52300.2%\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8def\u5f84\u590d\u73b0\u539f\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u5f97\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u751a\u81f3\u76f8\u53cd\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6790\u51b3\u7b56\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u8fdc\u8d85\u9884\u671f\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u7ed3\u5408\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8bba\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}
