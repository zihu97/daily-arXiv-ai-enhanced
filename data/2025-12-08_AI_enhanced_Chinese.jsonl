We propose FedGMR - Federated Learning with Gradual Model Restoration under Asynchrony and Model Heterogeneity. FedGMR progressively increases each client's sub-model density during training, enabling BCCs to remain effective contributors throughout the process. In addition, we develop a mask-aware aggregation rule tailored for asynchronous MHFL and provide convergence guarantees showing that aggregated error scales with the average sub-model density across clients and rounds, while GMR provably shrinks this gap toward full-model FL.

Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity.

However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations.

Stellis features a powerful matching mechanism and a flexible action description, enabling the straightforward encoding of a wide range of strategies. To ensure strategy soundness, we introduce an algorithm that generates a soundness condition for each strategy, thereby reducing the soundness of each strategy to the correctness of its soundness condition. Furthermore, based on a mechanized reduction soundness theorem, our prototype implementation generates correctness proofs for the overall automation.

Most often, LLMs are designed as \"general purpose\" technologies meant to represent the general population. Unfortunately, this often means alignment with predominantly Western Caucasian narratives and misalignment with other cultures and populations that engage in collaborative innovation. In response to this misalignment, there have been recent efforts centered on the development of \"culturally-informed\" LLMs, such as ChatBlackGPT, that are capable of better aligning with historically marginalized experiences and perspectives. Despite this progress, there has been little effort aimed at supporting our ability to develop and evaluate culturally-informed LLMs. A recent effort proposed an approach for developing a national alignment benchmark that emphasizes alignment with national social values and common knowledge. However, given the range of cultural identities present in the United States (U.S.), a national alignment benchmark is an ineffective goal for broader representation. To help fill this gap in this US context, we propose a replication study that translates the process used to develop KorNAT, a Korean National LLM alignment benchmark, to develop CIVIQ, a Cultural Intelligence and Values Inference Quality benchmark centered on alignment with community social values and common knowledge.

We report a two-phase qualitative study with 20 software engineers to understand this. In Phase I, participants exchanged peer reviews and were interviewed about their affective responses and engagement decisions. In Phase II, we introduced a new prompt matching engineers' preferences and probed how characteristics shaped their reactions. We develop an integrative account linking emotional self-regulation to behavioral engagement and resolution. We identify self-regulation strategies that engineers use to regulate their emotions in response to negative feedback: reframing, dialogic regulation, avoidance, and defensiveness. Engagement proceeds through social calibration; engineers align their responses and behaviors to the relational climate and team norms. Trajectories to resolution, in the case of peer-led review, vary by locus (solo/dyad/team) and an internal sense-making process. With the LLM-assisted review, emotional costs and the need for self-regulation seem lower. When LLM feedback aligned with engineers' cognitive expectations, participants reported reduced processing effort and a potentially higher tendency to adopt. We show that LLM-assisted review redirects engagement from emotion management to cognitive load management. We contribute an integrative model of engagement that links emotional self-regulation to behavioral engagement and resolution, showing how affective and cognitive processes influence feedback adoption in peer-led and LLM-assisted code reviews.

We report on the industrial deployment of WhatsCode, a domain-specific AI development system that supports WhatsApp (serving over 2 billion users) and processes millions of lines of code across multiple platforms. Over 25 months (2023-2025), WhatsCode evolved from targeted privacy automation to autonomous agentic workflows integrated with end-to-end feature development and DevOps processes.\n  WhatsCode achieved substantial quantifiable impact, improving automated privacy verification coverage 3.5x from 15% to 53%, identifying privacy requirements, and generating over 3,000 accepted code changes with acceptance rates ranging from 9% to 100% across different automation domains. The system committed 692 automated refactor/fix changes, 711 framework adoptions, 141 feature development assists and maintained 86% precision in bug triage. Our study identifies two stable human-AI collaboration patterns that emerged from production deployment: one-click rollout for high-confidence changes (60% of cases) and commandeer-revise for complex decisions (40%). We demonstrate that organizational factors, such as ownership models, adoption dynamics, and risk management, are as decisive as technical capabilities for enterprise-scale AI success.

By adopting AI-driven modernization strategies such as automated code refactoring, migration of data using smart tools, and predictive maintenance, companies can easily move to microservices, containerized environments, and hybrid cloud platforms. Machine learning models have the capability to go through legacy codebases, figure out efficiency opportunities, and carry out automated testing and deployment. Besides that, AI improves the organization's operational efficiency by generating the insights that can be used to level the workload and detect the anomalies.

While these models promise precise and personalized control, they also introduce new safety risks when model outputs are delivered directly to neural tissue. We propose a systematic, quantitative approach to detect and characterize unsafe stimulation patterns in ML-driven neurostimulation systems. Approach: We adapt an automated software testing technique known as coverage-guided fuzzing to the domain of neural stimulation. Here, fuzzing performs stress testing by perturbing model inputs and tracking whether resulting stimulation violates biophysical limits on charge density, instantaneous current, or electrode co-activation. The framework treats encoders as black boxes and steers exploration with coverage metrics that quantify how broadly test cases span the space of possible outputs and violation types. Main results: Applied to deep stimulus encoders for the retina and cortex, the method systematically reveals diverse stimulation regimes that exceed established safety limits.

The emerging challenge is no longer model fine-tuning but context engineering-how systems capture, structure, and govern external knowledge, memory, tools, and human input to enable trustworthy reasoning. Existing practices such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool integration remain fragmented, producing transient artefacts that limit traceability and accountability. This paper proposes a file-system abstraction for context engineering, inspired by the Unix notion that 'everything is a file'. The abstraction offers a persistent, governed infrastructure for managing heterogeneous context artefacts through uniform mounting, metadata, and access control. Implemented within the open-source AIGNE framework, the architecture realises a verifiable context-engineering pipeline, comprising the Context Constructor, Loader, and Evaluator, that assembles, delivers, and validates context under token constraints. As GenAI becomes an active collaborator in decision support, humans play a central role as curators, verifiers, and co-reasoners. The proposed architecture establishes a reusable foundation for accountable and human-centred AI co-work, demonstrated through two exemplars: an agent with memory and an MCP-based GitHub assistant. The implementation within the AIGNE framework demonstrates how the architecture can be operationalised in developer and industrial settings, supporting verifiable, maintainable, and industry-ready GenAI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u7a0b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u7a0b\u6280\u672f\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u4fe1\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274Unix\u2018\u4e00\u5207\u7686\u6587\u4ef6\u2019\u7406\u5ff5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6AIGNE\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6784\u9020\u5668\u3001\u52a0\u8f7d\u5668\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f53\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548cGitHub\u52a9\u624b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To better understand this gap, this study captures practitioners' perspectives on leveraging generative AI, based on a cross-company workshop with six organizations.

Although prior work notes behavioral and other non-technical factors in AI integration, most studies still emphasize technical concerns and offer limited insight into how teams adapt to and trust AI. This paper proposes a Behavioral Software Engineering (BSE)-informed, human-centric framework to support SE organizations during early AI adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, we built and refined the framework through a literature review of organizational change models and thematic analysis of interview data, producing concrete, actionable steps. The framework comprises nine dimensions: AI Strategy Design, AI Strategy Evaluation, Collaboration, Communication, Governance and Ethics, Leadership, Organizational Culture, Organizational Dynamics, and Up-skilling, each supported by design principles and actions. To gather preliminary practitioner input, we conducted a survey (N=105) and two expert workshops (N=4). Survey results show that Up-skilling (15.2%) and AI Strategy Design (15.1%) received the highest $100-method allocations, underscoring their perceived importance in early AI initiatives.

Yet, as external threats such as software supply chain attacks on project health and quality assurance increase, mechanisms for assigning and enforcing responsibility have become increasingly critical. In 2017, GitHub introduced the CODEOWNERS feature, which automatically designates reviewers for specific files to strengthen accountability and protect critical parts of the codebase. Despite its potential, little is known about how CODEOWNERS is actually adopted and practiced. We present the first large-scale empirical study of CODEOWNERS usage across over 844,000 pull requests with 1.9 million comments and over 2 million reviews. We identify 10,287 code owners to track their review activities. Results indicate that codeowners tend to adhere the rules specified in the CODEOWNERS file, exhibit similar collaborative behaviours to traditional metrics of ownership, but tend to contribute to a smoother and faster PR workflow over time. Finally, using regression discontinuity design (RDD) analysis, we find that repositories adopting CODEOWNERS experience shifts in review dynamics, as ownership redistributes review responsibilities away from core developers. Our results position CODEOWNERS as a promising yet underutilized mechanism for improving software governance and resilience. We discuss how projects can leverage this alternative ownership method as a perspective to enhance security, accountability, and workflow efficiency in open-source development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790GitHub\u7684CODEOWNERS\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d23\u4efb\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u5f3a\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u6240\u6709\u6743\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u9879\u76ee\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u679084.4\u4e07\u6b21PR\u3001190\u4e07\u6761\u8bc4\u8bba\u53ca200\u4e07\u6b21\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a10,287\u540d\u4ee3\u7801\u6240\u6709\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528RDD\u5206\u6790\u5ba1\u67e5\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "CODEOWNERS\u7528\u6237\u9075\u5b88\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u534f\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4f20\u7edf\u6240\u6709\u6743\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u79fb\u63d0\u5347PR\u6d41\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u540e\uff0c\u5ba1\u67e5\u8d23\u4efb\u4ece\u6838\u5fc3\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5206\u6563\u3002", "conclusion": "CODEOWNERS\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6cbb\u7406\u4e0e\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u9879\u76ee\u91c7\u7eb3\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u95ee\u8d23\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In such systems, end-to-end user requests traverse multiple different services and machines, exhibiting intricate interactions. Consequently, cloud service systems are vulnerable to concurrency bugs, which pose significant challenges to their reliability. Existing methods for concurrency bug detection often fall short due to their intrusive nature and inability to handle the architectural complexities of microservices. To address these limitations, we propose MicroRacer, a non-intrusive and automated framework for detecting concurrency bugs in such environments. By dynamically instrumenting widely-used libraries at runtime, MicroRacer collects detailed trace data without modifying the application code. Such data are utilized to analyze the happened-before relationship and resource access patterns of common operations within service systems. Based on this information, MicroRacer identifies suspicious concurrent operations and employs a three-stage validation process to test and confirm concurrency bugs.

This flexibility, however, makes correctness harder to ensure as the same extensibility that accelerates development also complicates maintaining the testing infrastructure. Extensible languages require automated test generation that is both dialect-agnostic (works across dialects without manual adaptation) and dialect-effective (targets dialect-specific features to find bugs). Existing approaches typically sacrifice one of these goals by either requiring manually constructed seed corpora for each dialect, or by failing to be effective. We present a dialect-agnostic and dialect-effective grammar-based and coverage-guided fuzzing approach for extensible compilers that combines two key insights from existing work: (i) the grammars of dialects, which already encode the structural and type constraints, can often be extracted automatically from the dialect specification; and (ii) these grammars can be used in combination with pre-trained large language models to automatically generate representative and diverse seed inputs from the full dialect space without requiring any manual input or training data. These seeds can then be used to bootstrap coverage-guided fuzzers. We built this approach into a tool, Germinator. When evaluated on six MLIR projects spanning 91 dialects, Germinator generated seeds improve line coverage by 10-120% over grammar-based baselines. We compare against grammar-based baselines because they are the only class of existing automatic seed generators that can be applied uniformly across MLIR's heterogeneous dialect ecosystem.

We propose reframing this as a natural language reasoning task by transforming codebases into hierarchical NL summaries and performing NL-to-NL search instead of cross-modal retrieval. Our approach builds context-aware summaries at file, directory, and repository levels, then uses a two-phase search: first routing bug reports to relevant repositories, then performing top-down localization within those repositories. Evaluated on DNext, an industrial system with 46 repositories and 1.1M lines of code, our method achieves Pass@10 of 0.82 and MRR of 0.50, significantly outperforming retrieval baselines and agentic RAG systems like GitHub Copilot and Cursor. This work demonstrates that engineered natural language representations can be more effective than raw source code for scalable bug localization, providing an interpretable repository -> directory -> file search path, which is vital for building trust in enterprise AI tools by providing essential transparency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6458\u8981\u5e76\u6267\u884cNL-to-NL\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4ed3\u5e93\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7f3a\u9677\u62a5\u544a\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3001LLM\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9650\u5236\u53ca\u9700\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u6b63\u786e\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6587\u4ef6\u3001\u76ee\u5f55\u548c\u4ed3\u5e93\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u641c\u7d22\uff1a\u5148\u8def\u7531\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u518d\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u542b46\u4e2a\u4ed3\u5e93\u548c110\u4e07\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u7684DNext\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0cPass@10\u8fbe0.82\uff0cMRR\u8fbe0.50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u7ebf\u548cGitHub Copilot\u7b49RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u6e90\u7801\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7f3a\u9677\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4f01\u4e1aAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}
