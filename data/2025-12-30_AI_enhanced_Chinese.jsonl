While previous research has shown that LiDAR perception can be manipulated through object based spoofing and injection attacks, the impact of such attacks on vehicle safety controllers is still not well understood. This paper presents a systematic failure analysis of longitudinal safety controllers under object based LiDAR attacks in highway driving scenarios. The study focuses on realistic cut in and car following situations in which adversarial objects introduce persistent perception errors without directly modifying vehicle control software. A high fidelity simulation framework integrating LiDAR perception, object tracking, and closed loop vehicle control is used to evaluate how false and displaced object detections propagate through the perception planning and control pipeline. The results demonstrate that even short duration LiDAR induced object hallucinations can trigger unsafe braking, delayed responses to real hazards, and unstable control behavior. In cut in scenarios, a clear increase in unsafe deceleration events and time to collision violations is observed when compared to benign conditions, despite identical controller parameters. The analysis further shows that controller failures are more strongly influenced by the temporal consistency of spoofed objects than by spatial inaccuracies alone. These findings reveal a critical gap between perception robustness and control level safety guarantees in autonomous driving systems. By explicitly characterizing safety controller failure modes under adversarial perception, this work provides practical insights for the design of attack aware safety mechanisms and more resilient control strategies for LiDAR dependent autonomous vehicles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u4f53\u7684LiDAR\u653b\u51fb\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eb5\u5411\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u611f\u77e5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9LiDAR\u611f\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f86\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u6548\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210LiDAR\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u95ed\u73af\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u865a\u5047\u548c\u4f4d\u79fb\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u611f\u77e5-\u89c4\u5212-\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u77ed\u6682\u7684LiDAR\u5e7b\u8c61\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5236\u52a8\u3001\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u5371\u9669\u53cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ca\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u5207\u5165\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u51cf\u901f\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdd\u89c4\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff1b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5931\u6548\u66f4\u53d7\u6b3a\u9a97\u7269\u4f53\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u653b\u51fb\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u548c\u589e\u5f3aLiDAR\u4f9d\u8d56\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5b89\u5168\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5b9e\u8df5\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002"}}

However, LLMs sometimes generate hallucinations, i.e.,unrealistic or illogical content, which leads to incorrect SQL queries and negatively impacts downstream applications. Detecting these hallucinations is particularly challenging. Existing Text-to-SQL error detection methods, which are tailored for traditional deep learning models, face significant limitations when applied to LLMs. This is primarily due to the scarcity of ground-truth data. To address this challenge, we propose SQLHD, a novel hallucination detection method based on metamorphic testing (MT) that does not require standard answers. SQLHD splits the detection task into two sequentiial stages: schema-linking hallucination detection via eight structure-aware Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that perturb comparative words, entities, sentence structure or database schema, and logical-synthesis hallucination detection via nine logic-aware MRs that mutate prefix words, extremum expressions, comparison ranges or the entire database. In each stage the LLM is invoked separately to generate schema mappings or SQL artefacts; the follow-up outputs are cross-checked against their source counterparts through the corresponding MRs, and any violation is flagged as a hallucination without requiring ground-truth SQL. The experimental results demonstrate our method's superior performance in terms of the F1-score, which ranges from 69.36\\% to 82.76\\%. Additionally, SQLHD demonstrates superior performance over LLM Self-Evaluation methods, effectively identifying hallucinations in Text-to-SQL tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSQLHD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8715\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u68c0\u6d4bText-to-SQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u51c6\u7b54\u6848\u4e14F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe69.36%-82.76%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8715\u53d8\u5173\u7cfb\u6270\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176F1\u5206\u6570\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u8d85\u8d8aLLM\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SQLHD\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u573a\u666f\u4e0bLLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347Text-to-SQL\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Large language model methods often assume kernels can be compiled and executed cheaply, which fails in large applications where full builds and runs are expensive. We present an end-to-end LLM framework with performance feedback that optimizes kernels without building the full application. From independently extracted hotspot kernels, it automatically completes code into a Minimal Executable Program (MEP), then performs multi-round iterative optimization and evaluation outside the full application. The framework integrates Automatic Error Repair and Performance Pattern Inheritance to fix faults, preserve correctness, reuse effective tiling/memory/synchronization strategies, and reduce search cost. Optimized variants are reintegrated into the original application for validation.

Includes appendices", "summary": "Consistent hashing is fundamental to distributed systems, but ring-based schemes can exhibit high peak-to-average load ratios unless they use many virtual nodes, while multi-probe methods improve balance at the cost of scattered memory accesses. This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), which preserves a token ring but restricts Highest Random Weight (HRW) selection to a cache-local window of C distinct neighboring physical nodes. LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted).

In contrast to regular multi-agent path-finding, the solver finds and updates the assignment of goals to the agents on its own. In the continuous case for a point agent with motions in the Euclidean plane, the problem can be solved arbitrarily close to optimal. For discrete variants that incur node and edge conflicts, we show that it can be solved in polynomial time, which is unexpected, since traditional vehicle routing on general graphs is NP-hard. We implement a corresponding planner that finds conflict-free optimized routes for the agents.

Although widely publicized as a productivity breakthrough, little is known about how practitioners actually define and engage in these practices.

Our findings reveal a spectrum of behaviors: some vibe coders rely almost entirely on AI without inspecting code, while others examine and adapt generated outputs. Across approaches, all must contend with the stochastic nature of generation, with debugging and refinement often described as \"rolling the dice.\" Further, divergent mental models, shaped by vibe coders' expertise and reliance on AI, influence prompting strategies, evaluation practices, and levels of trust.

Optimization of resource allocation configuration parameters for CPU and memory during the Release phase remains a largely unexplored problem as most research has focused on intelligent scheduling and autoscaling of microservices during the Ops stage of the DevOps cycle. Yet horizontal auto-scaling of containers, based on CPU usage for instance, may still leave these containers with an inappropriately allocated amount of memory, if no upfront fine-tuning of both resources is applied before the Deployment phase. We evaluate the performance optimization framework using the TeaStore microservice application and statistically compare different optimization algorithms, supporting informed decisions about their trade-offs between sampling cost and distance to the optimal resource configuration. This shows that upfront factor screening, for reducing the search space, is helpful when the goal is to find the optimal resource configuration with an affordable sampling budget. When the goal is to statistically compare different algorithms, screening must also be applied to make data collection of all data points in the search space feasible.

This need arises from the significant resource constraints-such as computational cost and energy consumption-associated with deploying AI algorithms, which involve intensive mathematical operations across multiple layers. High-power-consuming operations, including General Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) and activation functions, can be optimized to address these challenges. Optimization strategies for AI at the edge include algorithmic approaches like quantization and pruning, as well as hardware methodologies such as domain-specific accelerators.

TYTAN targets the acceleration of non-linear activation functions while minimizing power consumption. The TYTAN integrates a re-configurable hardware design with a specialized algorithm that dynamically estimates the necessary approximation for each activation function, aimed at achieving minimal deviation from baseline accuracy.

The current elderly care system faces significant challenges, including insufficient long-term care resources and poor communication between healthcare providers. To address this limitation, this study introduces a novel Starlink-assisted IOMT-based elderly healthcare model designed to improve remote patient monitoring and communication reliability. This proposal system focused on a monitoring system of key biomedical parameters such as electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, heart attack indicators, and a fall detection alert system. Performance is evaluated using the network simulator (NS-3) to assess its effectiveness in remote and underserved regions. Physiological data collected from patients are transmitted through a local communication hub and forwarded over a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite link to a medical center. Based on Quality of Service (QoS) technology that combines Flow Queuing (FQ) with Controlled Delay (CoDel) with Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) marking. This approach prioritizes critical health data for faster transmission while allocating lower priority to non-urgent information. This architecture is entirely wireless, allowing continuous monitoring, real-time alerts, and secure data storage for medical analysis. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Starlink-enabled IOMT system outperforms existing solutions in terms of throughput, latency, and reliability.

This task is fundamental yet challenging in automated software engineering due to the semantic gap between issue description and source code implementation. This gap manifests as two mismatches:(1) symptom-to-cause mismatches, where descriptions do not explicitly reveal underlying root causes; (2) one-to-many mismatches, where a single issue corresponds to multiple interdependent code entities. To address these two mismatches, we propose GraphLocator, an approach that mitigates symptom-to-cause mismatches through causal structure discovering and resolves one-to-many mismatches via dynamic issue disentangling. The key artifact is the causal issue graph (CIG), in which vertices represent discovered sub-issues along with their associated code entities, and edges encode the causal dependencies between them. The workflow of GraphLocator consists of two phases: symptom vertices locating and dynamic CIG discovering; it first identifies symptom locations on the repository graph, then dynamically expands the CIG by iteratively reasoning over neighboring vertices. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of GraphLocator: (1) Compared with baselines, GraphLocator achieves more accurate localization with average improvements of +19.49% in function-level recall and +11.89% in precision. (2) GraphLocator outperforms baselines on both symptom-to-cause and one-to-many mismatch scenarios, achieving recall improvement of +16.44% and +19.18%, precision improvement of +7.78% and +13.23%, respectively.

To address this challenge, we present HLS4PC, a parameterizable HLS framework for FPGA acceleration. Our approach leverages FPGA parallelization and algorithmic optimizations to enable efficient fixed-point implementations of both mapping and NN functions.

Recent efforts toward edge-cloud collaboration have attempted to mitigate this issue, but most existing methods adopt coarse-grained task allocation strategies-assigning entire queries either to the edge or the cloud. Such rigid partitioning fails to exploit fine-grained reasoning parallelism and often leads to redundant computation and inefficient resource utilization. To this end, we propose HybridFlow, a resource-adaptive inference framework that enables fast and token-efficient collaborative reasoning between edge and cloud LLMs. HybridFlow operates in two stages: (1) task decomposition and parallel execution, which dynamically splits a complex query into interdependent subtasks that can execute as soon as their dependencies are resolved; and (2) resource-aware subtask routing, where a learned router adaptively assigns each subtask to the edge or cloud model according to predicted utility gains and real-time budget states.

However, localizing these faults to specific source files remains highly challenging due to the complexity and scale of modern compiler infrastructures. In this study, we propose MultiConf, a novel approach that automatically isolates compiler faults by constructing multiple pairs of adversarial compilation configurations. Each adversarial compilation configuration pair consists of a failing configuration and its corresponding passing configuration, which differ in only a small number of fine-grained options. MultiConf generates failing configurations through a lightweight construction process and derives the corresponding passing configurations by selectively disabling bug-related fine-grained options. We then employ a Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) formula to rank the suspiciousness of compiler source files. Each adversarial configuration pair independently produces a ranking, which is subsequently aggregated using a weighted voting scheme to derive a final suspiciousness ranking, enabling more accurate and robust fault localization. We evaluate MultiConf on a benchmark of 60 real-world GCC compiler bugs. The results demonstrate that MultiConf significantly outperforms existing compiler fault localization techniques in both effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, MultiConf successfully localizes 27 out of 60 bugs at the Top-1 file level, representing improvements of 35.0% and 28.6% over the two state-of-the-art approaches, Odfl(20) and Basic(21), respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "MultiConf\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7f16\u8bd1\u914d\u7f6e\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u8c31\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6545\u969c\u6587\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5f15\u53d1\u6545\u969c\u7684\u6e90\u6587\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7ec4\u4ec5\u542b\u5c11\u91cf\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9009\u9879\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u7f16\u8bd1\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\uff0c\u5229\u7528SBFL\u516c\u5f0f\u72ec\u7acb\u6392\u5e8f\u53ef\u7591\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u518d\u4ee5\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u805a\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u6392\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u572860\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9eGCC\u7f3a\u9677\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTop-1\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe45%\uff0827/60\uff09\uff0c\u8f83Odfl\u548cBasic\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534735.0%\u4e0e28.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiConf\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Furthermore, relying on match-based metrics that compare generated patches to reference fixes at the token level has some limitations, failing to account for the possibility of various valid ways to patch the vulnerability.

Decentralized foundation model training across edge devices, leveraging their spare compute, promises a democratized alternative. However, existing edge-training approaches fall short: they struggle to match cloud-based training performance, exhibit limited scalability with model size, exceed device memory capacity, and have prohibitive communication overhead. They also fail to satisfactorily handle device heterogeneity and dynamism.\n  We introduce a new paradigm, Cleave, which finely partitions training operations through a novel selective hybrid tensor parallelism method. Together with a parameter server centric training framework, Cleave copes with device memory limits and avoids communication bottlenecks, thereby enabling efficient training of large models on par with the cloud. Further, with a cost optimization model to guide device selection and training workload distribution, Cleave effectively accounts for device heterogeneity and churn.\n  Our evaluations show that Cleave matches cloud-based GPU training by scaling efficiently to larger models and thousands of devices, supporting up to 8x more devices than baseline edge-training approaches. It outperforms state-of-the-art edge training methods by up to a factor of 10 in per-batch training time and efficiently handles device failures, achieving at least 100x faster recovery than prior methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cleave\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4e91\u7aef\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff1bCleave\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u95f2\u7f6e\u7b97\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5212\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6210\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u8bbe\u5907\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "Cleave\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u6570\u5343\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a8\u500d\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5355\u6279\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u534710\u500d\uff0c\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u767e\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "Cleave\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e91\u7aef\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

CFIghter integrates whole-program analysis with guided runtime monitoring and iteratively applies the minimal necessary adjustments to CFI enforcement only where required, stopping once all tests pass or remaining failures are deemed unresolvable. We evaluate CFIghter on four GNU projects. It resolves all visibility-related build errors and automatically repairs 95.8% of unintended CFI violations in the large, multi-library util-linux codebase, while retaining strict enforcement at over 89% of indirect control-flow sites. Across all subjects, CFIghter preserves strict type-based CFI for the majority of the codebase without requiring manual source-code changes, relying only on automatically generated visibility adjustments and localized enforcement scopes where necessary.

Existing RDMA transports, such as RoCE, IRN, SRNIC, and Falcon, enforce strict reliability and in-order delivery, relying on retransmissions and packet sequencing to ensure correctness. While these approaches work well for general-purpose workloads, they introduce complexity and latency that scale poorly in ML, where even rare packet delays can stall entire model pipelines.\n  We present OptiNIC, a domain-specific RDMA transport that revisits traditional reliability guarantees based on ML's tolerance for partial or missing data. OptiNIC eliminates retransmissions and in-order delivery from the NIC, enabling a best-effort, out-of-order transport model for RDMA. Unlike traditional RDMA, which signals completion only after complete data delivery, OptiNIC introduces adaptive timeouts to trigger forward progress when data may be lost or delayed. OptiNIC retains standard congestion control mechanisms (e.g., DCQCN, EQDS, or Swift) while shifting loss recovery to the ML pipeline itself (e.g., via the Hadamard Transform and Erasure Coding).\n  Our evaluation shows that OptiNIC improves time-to-accuracy (TTA) by 2x and increases throughput by 1.6x for training and inference, respectively, across two public clouds (i.e., Hyperstack and CloudLab).

We show in this work how publicly available LLMs can be socially engineered to transform novices into capable attackers, challenging the foundational principle that exploitation requires technical expertise. To that end, we propose RSA (Role-assignment, Scenario-pretexting, and Action-solicitation), a pretexting strategy that manipulates LLMs into generating functional exploits despite their safety mechanisms. Testing against Odoo -- a widely used ERP platform, we evaluated five mainstream LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and DeepSeek) and achieved a 100% success rate: tested CVE yielded at least one working exploit within 3-4 prompting rounds. While prior work [13] found LLM-assisted attacks difficult and requiring manual effort, we demonstrate that this overhead can be eliminated entirely.\n  Our findings invalidate core software engineering security principles: the distinction between technical and non-technical actors no longer provides valid threat models; technical complexity of vulnerability descriptions offers no protection when LLMs can abstract it away; and traditional security boundaries dissolve when the same tools that build software can be manipulated to break it. This represents a paradigm shift in software engineering -- we must redesign security practices for an era where exploitation requires only the ability to craft prompts, not understand code.\n  Artifacts available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/From-Rookie-to-Attacker-D8B3.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRSA\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u914d\u3001\u573a\u666f\u9884\u8bbe\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u8bf1\u5bfc\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8ba9\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8fd0\u884c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u6280\u672f\u4eba\u5458\u96f6\u95e8\u69db\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u98a0\u8986\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u793e\u4f1a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u4f7f\u65e0\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8005\u4e5f\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u653b\u51fb\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6311\u6218\u2018\u653b\u51fb\u9700\u6280\u672f\u4e13\u957f\u2019\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u524d\u63d0\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1RSA\u4e09\u6b65\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u914d\u3001\u573a\u666f\u9884\u8bbe\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u8bf1\u5bfc\uff09\uff0c\u5728Odoo\u5e73\u53f0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e94\u6b3e\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u751f\u6210CVE\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4e94\u6b3eLLM\u5747100%\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u57283-4\u8f6e\u63d0\u793a\u5185\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7528\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u653b\u51fb\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b89\u5168\u8303\u5f0f\u9700\u91cd\u6784\uff1a\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u975e\u6280\u672f\u4eba\u5458\u754c\u9650\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0d\u518d\u6784\u6210\u9632\u62a4\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u9632\u5fa1\u3002"}}

This paper presents an adaptive GPU resource allocation framework that achieves 85\\% latency reduction compared to round-robin scheduling while maintaining comparable throughput to static allocation, using an $O(N)$ complexity algorithm for real-time adaptation. Our approach dynamically allocates GPU resources based on workload characteristics, agent priorities, and minimum resource requirements, enabling efficient utilization while maintaining quality of service. The framework addresses three key challenges: (1) heterogeneous computational demands across lightweight coordinators and heavyweight specialists, (2) dynamic workload fluctuations requiring millisecond-scale reallocation, and (3) capacity constraints in serverless environments. Through comprehensive simulations modeling realistic multi-agent workflows with four heterogeneous agents, we demonstrate that adaptive allocation outperforms static equal and round-robin strategies across latency, cost, and GPU utilization metrics.

These bugs necessitate the research and practice of code optimization. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually designing and maintaining rules for specific performance bugs (e.g., redundant loops, repeated computations), making them labor-intensive and limited in applicability. In recent years, machine learning and deep learning-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives by learning optimization heuristics from annotated code corpora and performance measurements. However, these approaches usually depend on specific program representations and meticulously crafted training datasets, making them costly to develop and difficult to scale.

They do so by organizing computation around explicit, compiler-managed data movement over the on-chip network, allowing operands to be directly forwarded between processing elements and reducing reliance on high-latency, bandwidth-limited global shared memory. Such localized communications can provide higher throughput and efficiency compared to repeated off-chip memory accesses. However, their end-to-end performance depends strongly on how workloads are mapped to the hardware. Naive mappings can perform very poorly, and most users rely on hand-tuned vendor libraries. In practice, although existing spatial-dataflow accelerators have strong potential for high performance, energy- and cost-efficiency, their limited programmability remains a major barrier to their wider adoption. This paper presents TL, an end-to-end framework that compiles tile-based programs (such as Triton kernels) onto spatial dataflow architectures. Unlike most existing compiler frameworks that focus on optimizing code generation within a single tile, TL addresses the central challenge of distributing tile instances across spatially distributed cores and exploiting the on-chip network and distributed memories to increase data reuse and reduce communications. TL proposes a hardware representation that captures interconnect topology, memory hierarchy, and compute capabilities, enabling both specialized architecture-specific optimizations and support for diverse spatial dataflow targets.

However, the execution of these workflows still typically requires technical expertise in setting up calculation inputs, interpreting outputs, and handling the complexity of parallel code execution on remote machines. To address these challenges, the AiiDAlab platform was developed, making complex computational workflows accessible through an intuitive user interface that runs in a web browser. Here, we discuss how AiiDAlab has matured over the past few years, shifting its focus from computational materials science to become a powerful platform that accelerates scientific discovery across multiple disciplines. Thanks to its design, AiiDAlab allows scientists to focus on their research rather than on computational details and challenges, while keeping automatically track of the full simulation provenance via the underlying AiiDA engine and thus ensuring reproducibility. In particular, we discuss its adoption into quantum chemistry, atmospheric modeling, battery research, and even experimental data analysis at large-scale facilities, while also being actively used in educational settings. Driven by user feedback, significant effort has been made to simplify user onboarding, streamline access to computational resources, and provide robust mechanisms to work with large datasets. Furthermore, AiiDAlab is being integrated with electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs), reinforcing adherence to the FAIR principles and supporting researchers in data-centric scientific disciplines in easily generating reproducible Open Research Data (ORD).", "AI": {"tldr": "AiiDAlab\u5e73\u53f0\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u754c\u9762\u7b80\u5316\u590d\u6742\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u79d1\u7814\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u79d1\u7814\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u8d85\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5173\u8054\u6a21\u62df\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6280\u672f\u95e8\u69db\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u5316\u5e73\u53f0AiiDAlab\uff0c\u96c6\u6210AiiDA\u5f15\u64ce\u81ea\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u62df\u6eaf\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5e73\u53f0\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u5927\u6c14\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u7535\u6c60\u7814\u7a76\u53ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u6559\u5b66\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7535\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5f55\u672c\u6574\u5408\u4ee5\u7b26\u5408FAIR\u539f\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "AiiDAlab\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u79d1\u7814\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4e13\u6ce8\u79d1\u5b66\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u969c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e0e\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u7814\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

These faults silently corrupt internal parameters and can lead to unpredictable or dangerous model behavior. Localizing these corruptions is essential: without identifying the affected region, it is impossible to diagnose the source of degradation, apply targeted corrective measures, or restore model functionality without resorting to costly fine-tuning or full retraining. This work introduces BitFlipScope, a scalable, software-based framework for identifying fault-affected regions within transformer architectures under two deployment scenarios. When a clean reference model is available, BitFlipScope performs differential analysis of outputs, hidden states, and internal activations for detecting anomalous behavior indicative of corruption to pinpoint or localize faults. When no reference model exists, it uses residual-path perturbation and loss-sensitivity profiling to infer the fault-impacted region directly from the corrupted model. In both settings, the framework not only enables effective fault diagnosis but also supports lightweight performance recovery without fine-tuning, offering a practical path to restoring corrupted models. Together, these capabilities make BitFlipScope an important step toward trustworthy, fault-resilient LLM deployment in hardware-prone and adversarial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "BitFlipScope\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6545\u969c\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6709\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u4e24\u79cd\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u6216\u653b\u51fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBitFlipScope\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5206\u5206\u6790\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5f02\u5e38\uff1b\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u6270\u52a8\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u63a8\u65ad\u6545\u969c\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u6545\u969c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6613\u9519\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BitFlipScope\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u6297\u6545\u969c\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u786c\u4ef6\u5bb9\u9519LLM\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Presented at NeurIPS 2025 Efficient Reasoning Workshop", "summary": "Practical utilization of large-scale machine learning requires a powerful compute setup, a necessity which poses a significant barrier to engagement with such artificial intelligence in more restricted system environments. While cloud computing offers a solution to weaker local environments, certain situations like training involving private or sensitive data, physical environments not available through the cloud, or higher anticipated usage costs, necessitate computing locally. We explore the potential to improve weaker local compute systems at zero additional cost by taking advantage of ubiquitous yet underutilized resources: mobile phones. Specifically, recent iOS phones are equipped with surprisingly powerful processors, but they also face limitations like memory constraints, thermal throttling, and OS sandboxing.

Objective. This study aims to provide an overview of the status of GenAI adoption in SE. It investigates the status of GenAI adoption, associated benefits and challenges, institutionalization of tools and techniques, and anticipated long term impacts on SE professionals and the community. Results. The results indicate a wide adoption of GenAI tools and how they are deeply integrated into daily SE work, particularly for implementation, verification and validation, personal assistance, and maintenance-related tasks. Practitioners report substantial benefits, most notably reduction in cycle time, quality improvements, enhanced support in knowledge work, and productivity gains. However, objective measurement of productivity and quality remains limited in practice. Significant challenges persist, including incorrect or unreliable outputs, prompt engineering difficulties, validation overhead, security and privacy concerns, and risks of overreliance. Institutionalization of tools and techniques seems to be common, but it varies considerably, with a strong focus on tool access and less emphasis on training and governance.

When processing long inputs in RAG, the prefill phase of computing the key-value vectors of input text is energy-intensive and time-consuming even with high-end GPUs. Thus, it is crucial to make the prefill phase in RAG inference efficient. To address this issue, we propose MatKV, a scheme that precomputes the key-value vectors (KVs) of RAG objects (e.g., documents), materializes them in inexpensive but fast and power-efficient flash storage, and reuses them at inference time instead of recomputing the KVs using costly and power-inefficient GPU. Experimental results using Hugging Face's Transformers library across state-of-the-art GPUs and flash memory SSDs confirm that, compared to full KV computation on GPUs, MatKV reduces both inference time and power consumption by half for RAG workloads, without severely impacting accuracy in the question-answering task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MatKV enables additional optimizations in two ways. First, a GPU can decode text while simultaneously loading the materialized KVs for the next instance, reducing load latency. Second, since decoding speed is less sensitive to GPU performance than KV computation, low-end GPUs can be leveraged for decoding without significantly compromising speed once the materialized KVs are loaded into GPU memory. These findings underscore MatKV's potential to make large-scale generative AI applications more cost-effective, power-efficient, and accessible across a wider range of tasks and hardware environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "MatKV\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u5b58\u50a8RAG\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u952e\u503c\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "RAG\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u7684prefill\u9636\u6bb5\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u529f\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMatKV\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u952e\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u5e76\u5b58\u50a8\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901f\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u95ea\u5b58\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u590d\u7528\u800c\u975eGPU\u91cd\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMatKV\u4f7fRAG\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u529f\u8017\u51cf\u534a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u52a0\u8f7d\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7aefGPU\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "MatKV\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u4e0e\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To identify security-related discussions, we develop a pipeline that combines keyword matching with an optimal fine-tuned distilBERT classifier, which achieved the best performance in our extensive comparison of various deep learning and large language models. This pipeline produces a dataset of 312,868 security discussions, providing insights into the security reporting practices of AI applications and projects. We conduct a thematic analysis of 753 posts sampled from our dataset and uncover a fine-grained taxonomy of 32 security issues and 24 solutions across four themes: (1) System and Software, (2) External Tools and Ecosystem, (3) Model, and (4) Data.

However, despite the widespread adoption of GPUs, programmability remains a challenge, particularly in open-source contexts. In this paper, we present SPUMA, a full GPU porting of OPENFOAM targeting NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. The implementation strategy is based on a portable programming model and the adoption of a memory pool manager that leverages the unified memory feature of modern GPUs. This approach is discussed alongside several numerical tests conducted on two pre-exascale clusters in Europe, LUMI and Leonardo, which host AMD MI250X and NVIDIA A100 GPUs, respectively. In the performance analysis section, we present results related to memory usage profiling and kernel wall-time, the impact of the memory pool, and energy consumption obtained by simulating the well-known DrivAer industrial test case. GPU utilization strongly affects strong scalability results, reaching 65% efficiency on both LUMI and Leonardo when approaching a load of 8 million cells per GPU. Weak scalability results, obtained on 20 GPUs with the OpenFOAM native multigrid solver, range from 75% on Leonardo to 85% on LUMI.

This paper investigates how Kubernetes autoscaling can be enhanced using AIOps principles to jointly satisfy SLO and cost constraints under diverse workload patterns without compromising safety or operational transparency. We present a gap-driven analysis of existing autoscaling approaches and propose a safe and explainable multi-signal autoscaling framework that integrates SLO-aware and cost-conscious control with lightweight demand forecasting.

This growth is largely driven by the widespread migration of applications to the Cloud, alongside a rising number of users consuming digital content. Dynamic adaptation (or self-adaptive) approaches appear as a way to reduce, at runtime and under certain constraints, the energy consumption of software applications.\n  [Question/Problem] Despite efforts to make energy-efficiency a primary goal in the dynamic adaptation of software applications, there is still a gap in understanding how to equip these self-adaptive software systems (SAS), which are dynamically adapted at runtime, with effective energy consumption monitoring tools that enable energy-awareness. Furthermore, the extent to which such an energy consumption monitoring tool impacts the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem has not yet been thoroughly explored.\n  [Methodology] To address this gap, we introduce the EnCoMSAS (Energy Consumption Monitoring for Self-Adaptive Systems) tool that allows to gather the energy consumed by distributed software applications deployed, for instance, in the Cloud. EnCoMSAS enables the evaluation of energy consumption of SAS variants at runtime. It allows to integrate energy-efficiency as a main goal in the analysis and execution of new adaptation plans for the SAS. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of EnCoMSAS and investigate its impact on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem, we conduct an empirical study by using the Adaptable TeaStore case study. Adaptable TeaStore is a self-adaptive extension of the TeaStore application, a microservice benchmarking application. For this study, we focus on the recommender service of Adaptable TeaStore. Regarding the experiments, we first equip Adaptable TeaStore with EnCoMSAS. Next, we execute Adaptable TeaStore by varying workload conditions that simulate users interactions. Finally, we use EnCoMSAS for gathering and assessing the energy consumption of the recommender algorithms of Adaptable TeaStore. To run these experiments, we use nodes of the Grid5000 testbed.\n  [Results] The results show that EnCoMSAS is effective in collecting energy consumption of software applications for enabling dynamic adaptation at runtime. The observed correlation between CPU usage and energy consumption collected by EnCoMSAS provides evidence supporting the validity of the collected energy measurements. Moreover, we point out, through EnCoMSAS, that energy consumption is influenced not only by the algorithmic complexity but also by the characteristics of the deployment environment. Finally, the results show that the impact of EnCoMSAS on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem is comparatively modest with respect to the entire set of the TeaStore applications microservices.", "AI": {"tldr": "EnCoMSAS\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u6d4b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u52a8\u6001\u8282\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u81ea\u8eab\u80fd\u8017\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u80fd\u8017\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u9700\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u5907\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u80fd\u8017\u76d1\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1EnCoMSAS\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728Adaptable TeaStore\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5e76\u5b9e\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u63a8\u8350\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "EnCoMSAS\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u91c7\u96c6\u80fd\u8017\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u5f00\u9500\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "EnCoMSAS\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u8017\u611f\u77e5\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, RL post-training interleaves training and inference workloads, exposing the system to faults from both sides. Existing fault tolerance frameworks for LLMs target either training or inference, leaving the optimization potential in the asynchronous execution unexplored for RL. Our key insight is role-based fault isolation so the failure in one machine does not affect the others. We treat trainer, rollout, and other management roles in RL training as distinct distributed sub-tasks. Instead of restarting the entire RL task in ByteRobust, we recover only the failed role and reconnect it to living ones, thereby eliminating the full-restart overhead including rollout replay and initialization delay.\n  We present RobustRL, the first comprehensive robust system to handle GPU machine errors for RL post-training Effective Training Time Ratio improvement. (1) \\textit{Detect}. We implement role-aware monitoring to distinguish actual failures from role-specific behaviors to avoid the false positive and delayed detection. (2) \\textit{Restart}. For trainers, we implement a non-disruptive recovery where rollouts persist state and continue trajectory generation, while the trainer is rapidly restored via rollout warm standbys. For rollout, we perform isolated machine replacement without interrupting the RL task. (3) \\textit{Reconnect}.

The evaluation results show that after applying parallelization with the proposed framework, all patterns show a reduction in execution time, confirming the effectiveness of parallelization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u652f\u6301ROS 2\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u77ed\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5e76\u53d1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709MBD\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u914dROS 2\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06ROS 2\u517c\u5bb9\u7684Simulink\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0e\u5b9a\u65f6\u9a71\u52a8\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6269\u5c55MBD\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u540e\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u652f\u6301ROS 2\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5e76\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Unlike standard LLM post-training, agentic RL workloads are highly heterogeneous, combining compute-intensive prefill phases, bandwidth-bound decoding, and stateful, CPU-heavy environment simulations. We argue that efficient agentic RL training requires disaggregated infrastructure to leverage specialized, best-fit hardware. However, naive disaggregation introduces substantial synchronization overhead and resource underutilization due to the complex dependencies between stages.\n  We present RollArc, a distributed system designed to maximize throughput for multi-task agentic RL on disaggregated infrastructure. RollArc is built on three core principles: (1) hardware-affinity workload mapping, which routes compute-bound and bandwidth-bound tasks to bestfit GPU devices, (2) fine-grained asynchrony, which manages execution at the trajectory level to mitigate resource bubbles, and (3) statefulness-aware computation, which offloads stateless components (e.g., reward models) to serverless infrastructure for elastic scaling. Our results demonstrate that RollArc effectively improves training throughput and achieves 1.35-2.05\\(\\times\\) end-to-end training time reduction compared to monolithic and synchronous baselines. We also evaluate RollArc by training a hundreds-of-billions-parameter MoE model for Qoder product on an Alibaba cluster with more than 3,000 GPUs, further demonstrating RollArc scalability and robustness.

In this implementation discussion paper, we examine how software architectural methods, the cloud-native Operator pattern, and legacy programming language techniques can decouple self-adaptive control logic from the TeaStore application. We analyze the trade-offs that these different approaches make between fine-grained expressive adaptation and system-wide control, and highlight when reuse of adaptation strategies is most effective.

However, these additions introduce a previously unexplored energy trade-off across modalities that remains poorly understood, as most prior work focuses on text-only models. In this paper, we examine modality inflation, a key source of inefficiency in which multimodal inputs increase inference workloads through extra encoding stages and expanded token sequences. We provide the first detailed, stage-level analysis of energy consumption in MLLM inference by breaking the pipeline into vision encoding, prefill, and decoding stages. Using four representative MLLMs evaluated on NVIDIA A100 GPU, we quantify the additional energy required for multimodal inference compared to text-only baselines, observing overheads ranging from 17% to 94% across models for identical inputs. Our results show that energy bottlenecks differ widely across model architectures, stemming either from compute-heavy vision encoders or from the downstream impact of large visual token sequences during prefill. By examining GPU power traces, we further uncover substantial GPU underutilization during multimodal execution and show that input complexity leads to markedly different energy scaling behaviors across models. Finally, we demonstrate that stage-wise dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is an effective optimization, allowing energy savings with only modest performance impact.
