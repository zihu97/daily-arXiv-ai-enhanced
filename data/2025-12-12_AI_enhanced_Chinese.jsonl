Preliminary version of an ongoing research project on natural language interfaces for firewall configuration", "summary": "This paper presents the design and prototype implementation of a natural language interface for configuring enterprise firewalls. The framework allows administrators to express access control policies in plain language, which are then translated into vendor specific configurations. A compact schema bound intermediate representation separates human intent from device syntax and in the current prototype compiles to Palo Alto PAN OS command line configuration while remaining extensible to other platforms. Large language models are used only as assistive parsers that generate typed intermediate representation objects, while compilation and enforcement remain deterministic. The prototype integrates three validation layers, namely a static linter that checks structural and vendor specific constraints, a safety gate that blocks overly permissive rules such as any to any allows, and a Batfish based simulator that validates configuration syntax and referential integrity against a synthetic device model. The paper describes the architecture, implementation, and test methodology on synthetic network context datasets and discusses how this approach can evolve into a scalable auditable and human centered workflow for firewall policy management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4f01\u4e1a\u9632\u706b\u5899\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u89e3\u6790\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8bbe\u5907\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u9a8c\u8bc1\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b80\u5316\u9632\u706b\u5899\u7b56\u7565\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u4e0e\u4eba\u6027\u5316\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u518d\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u5382\u5546\u547d\u4ee4\u884c\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u9759\u6001\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u95e8\u63a7\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e09\u5c42\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u652f\u6301Palo Alto\u5e73\u53f0\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9632\u706b\u5899\u7b56\u7565\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Traditional multi-project wafer (MPW) services based solely on physical co-placement have historically met this need, yet their scalability breaks down as project counts rise. Recent efforts towards scalable chip tapeouts mitigate these limitations by integrating many small designs within a shared die and attempt to amortize costly resources such as IO pads and memory macros. However, foundational principles for arranging, linking, and validating such densely integrated design sites have received limited systematic investigation. This work presents a new approach with three key techniques to address this gap. First, we establish a structured formulation of the design space that enables automated, algorithm-driven packing of many projects, replacing manual layout practices. Second, we introduce an architecture that exploits only the narrow-area regions between sites to deliver on off-chip communication and other shared needs. Third, we provide a practical approach for on-chip power domains enabling per-project power characterization at a standard laboratory bench and requiring no expertise in low-power ASIC design. Experimental results show that our approach achieves substantial area reductions of up to 13x over state-of-the-art physical-only aggregation methods, offering a scalable and cost-effective path forward for large-scale tapeout environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u7a84\u533a\u57df\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7247\u4e0a\u7535\u6e90\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u82af\u7247\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u9879\u76ee\u6676\u5706\u670d\u52a1\u5728\u9879\u76ee\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5bc6\u96c6\u96c6\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7b97\u6cd5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b2. \u5229\u7528\u7ad9\u70b9\u95f4\u7a84\u533a\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u7247\u5916\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u5171\u4eab\u529f\u80fd\uff1b3. \u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u9700\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7247\u4e0a\u7535\u6e90\u57df\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9762\u79ef\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe13\u500d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d41\u7247\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u4eba\u624d\u57f9\u517b\u548c\u79d1\u7814\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u82af\u7247\u96c6\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Embedding prudential norms as admissibility constraints and structuring communication into typed acts measurably enhances equilibrium stability.\n  Overall, the results suggest that regulated, simulator-driven decision environments are most naturally modelled as norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faR-CMASP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u6d89\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u53ca\u76d1\u7ba1\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6216\u5355\u4f53LLM\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u8d44\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6761\u6b3e\u89e3\u91ca\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u6700\u9002\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Benchmarking is crucial for optimizing efficiency in both model deployment and next-generation model development. To address this need, we open-source a simple profiling tool, \\textbf{ELANA}, for evaluating LLMs. ELANA is designed as a lightweight, academic-friendly profiler for analyzing model size, key-value (KV) cache size, prefilling latency (Time-to-first-token, TTFT), generation latency (Time-per-output-token, TPOT), and end-to-end latency (Time-to-last-token, TTLT) of LLMs on both multi-GPU and edge GPU platforms. It supports all publicly available models on Hugging Face and offers a simple command-line interface, along with optional energy consumption logging. Moreover, ELANA is fully compatible with popular Hugging Face APIs and can be easily customized or adapted to compressed or low bit-width models, making it ideal for research on efficient LLMs or for small-scale proof-of-concept studies.

This work investigates how a chip can be generated from a high-level object-oriented software specification, targeting introductory-level chip design learners with only very light performance requirements, while maintaining mental continuity between the chip layout and the software source program. In our approach, each software object is represented as a corresponding region on the die, producing a one-to-one structural mapping that preserves these familiar abstractions throughout the design flow. To support this mapping, we employ a modular construction strategy in which vertically composed IP blocks implement the behavioral protocols expressed in software. A direct syntactic translation, however, cannot meet hardware-level efficiency or communication constraints. For this reason, we leverage formal type systems based on sequences that check whether interactions between hardware modules adhere to the communication patterns described in the software model. We further examine hardware interconnect strategies for composing many such modules and develop layout techniques suited to this object-aligned design style. Together, these contributions preserve mental continuity from software to chip design for new learners and enables practical layout generation, ultimately reducing the expertise required for software developers to participate in chip creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u8f6f\u4ef6\u89c4\u8303\u751f\u6210\u82af\u7247\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u82af\u7247\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u5b9a\u5236\u786c\u4ef6\u878d\u5165\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e13\u7528\u7845\u7247\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548cAI\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5bf9\u8c61\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u82af\u7247\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u786e\u4fdd\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5230\u82af\u7247\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5165\u95e8\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u80fd\u66f4\u8f7b\u677e\u53c2\u4e0e\u82af\u7247\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u521b\u65b0\u3002"}}

But this benchmark may overlap with model training data. If that is true, scores may reflect training recall, not issue-solving skill. To study this, we test two Claude models that frequently appear in top-performing agents submitted to the benchmark. We ask them to find relevant files using only issue text, and then issue text plus file paths. We then run the same setup on BeetleBox and SWE-rebench. Despite both benchmarks involving popular open-source Python projects, models performed 3 times better on SWE-Bench-Verified. They were also 6 times better at finding edited files, without any additional context about the projects themselves. This gap suggests the models may have seen many SWE-Bench-Verified tasks during training. As a result, scores on this benchmark may not reflect an agent's ability to handle real software issues, yet it continues to be used in ways that can misrepresent progress and lead to choices that favour agents that use certain models over strong agent design.

Our agents maintain internal memory states while depositing persistent environmental traces, creating a spatially distributed collective memory without centralized control. Comprehensive validation across five environmental conditions (20x20 to 50x50 grids, 5-20 agents, 50 runs per configuration) reveals a critical asymmetry: individual memory alone provides 68.7% performance improvement over no-memory baselines (1563.87 vs 927.23, p < 0.001), while environmental traces without memory fail completely. This demonstrates that memory functions independently but traces require cognitive infrastructure for interpretation.

Yet, the BBV's fundamental limitations: order-dependent IDs that prevent cross-program knowledge reuse and a lack of semantic content predictive of hardware performance have left a massive potential for optimization untapped.\n  To address these gaps, we introduce SemanticBBV, a novel, two-stage framework that generates robust, performance-aware signatures for cross-program simulation reuse. First, a lightweight RWKV-based semantic encoder transforms assembly basic blocks into rich Basic Block Embeddings (BBEs), capturing deep functional semantics. Second, an order-invariant Set Transformer aggregates these BBEs, weighted by execution frequency, into a final signature. Crucially, this stage is co-trained with a dual objective: a triplet loss for signature distinctiveness and a Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) regression task, directly imbuing the signature with performance sensitivity. Our evaluation demonstrates that SemanticBBV not only matches traditional BBVs in single-program accuracy but also enables unprecedented cross-program analysis. By simulating just 14 universal program points, we estimated the performance of ten SPEC CPU benchmarks with 86.3% average accuracy, achieving a 7143x simulation speedup.

Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate LLM inference by using lightweight draft models to generate candidate tokens, which are subsequently verified by a larger, more accurate model. However, ensuring both high goodput (the effective rate of accepted tokens) and fairness across multiple draft servers cooperating with a central verification server remains an open challenge. This paper introduces GOODSPEED, a novel distributed inference framework that optimizes goodput through adaptive speculative decoding. GOODSPEED employs a central verification server that coordinates a set of heterogeneous draft servers, each running a small language model to generate speculative tokens. To manage resource allocation effectively, GOODSPEED incorporates a gradient scheduling algorithm that dynamically assigns token verification tasks, maximizing a logarithmic utility function to ensure proportional fairness across servers. By processing speculative outputs from all draft servers in parallel, the framework enables efficient collaboration between the verification server and distributed draft generators, streamlining both latency and throughput. Through rigorous fluid sample path analysis, we show that GOODSPEED converges to the optimal goodput allocation in steady-state conditions and maintains near-optimal performance with provably bounded error under dynamic workloads.

RLTune integrates RL-driven prioritization with MILP-based job-to-node mapping to optimize system-wide objectives such as job completion time (JCT), queueing delay, and resource utilization. Trained on large-scale production traces from Microsoft Philly, Helios, and Alibaba, RLTune improves GPU utilization by up to 20%, reduces queueing delay by up to 81%, and shortens JCT by as much as 70 percent. Unlike prior approaches, RLTune generalizes across diverse workloads without requiring per-job profiling, making it practical for cloud providers to deploy at scale for more efficient, fair, and sustainable DL workload management.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLTune\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5f02\u6784GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u914d\u7f6e\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65e5\u76ca\u5f02\u6784\u7684GPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e91\u5e73\u53f0\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08MILP\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5230\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5fae\u8f6fPhilly\u3001Helios\u53ca\u963f\u91cc\u751f\u4ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cRLTune\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u63d0\u534720% GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e81%\u6392\u961f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u7f29\u77ed70%\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "RLTune\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9010\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5546\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether existing approaches can effectively leverage such hybrid queries, particularly in cross-language contexts. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of representative code models and reveal three challenges: (1) insufficient semantic understanding; (2) inefficient fusion in hybrid code retrieval; and (3) weak generalization in cross-language scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniCoR, a novel self-supervised framework that learns Unified Code Representations framework designed to learn unified and robust code representations. Firstly, we design a multi-perspective supervised contrastive learning module to enhance semantic understanding and modality fusion. It aligns representations from multiple perspectives, including code-to-code, natural language-to-code, and natural language-to-natural language, enforcing the model to capture a semantic essence among modalities. Secondly, we introduce a representation distribution consistency learning module to improve cross-language generalization, which explicitly aligns the feature distributions of different programming languages, enabling language-agnostic representation learning. Extensive experiments on both empirical benchmark and large-scale benchmark show that UniCoR outperforms all baseline models, achieving an average improvement of 8.64% in MRR and 11.54% in MAP over the best-performing baseline. Furthermore, UniCoR exhibits stability in hybrid code retrieval and generalization capability in cross-language scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniCoR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\uff08\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00+\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff09\u53ca\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4f4e\u6548\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u5f31\u4e09\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniCoR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ece\u4ee3\u7801-\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00-\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00-\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e09\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u8868\u793a\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cUniCoR\u76f8\u8f83\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347MRR 8.64%\u3001MAP 11.54%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "UniCoR\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While datasets such as LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat capture real-world user-LLM conversations, few studies systematically explore the mechanisms of human-LLM collaboration in coding scenarios. What tortuous paths do users experience during the interaction process? How well do the LLMs follow instructions? Are users satisfied? In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis on human-LLM coding collaboration using LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat datasets to explore the human-LLM collaboration mechanism, LLMs' instruction following ability, and human satisfaction. This study yields interesting findings: 1) Task types shape interaction patterns(linear, star and tree), with code quality optimization favoring linear patterns, design-driven tasks leaning toward tree structures, and queries preferring star patterns; 2) Bug fixing and code refactoring pose greater challenges to LLMs' instruction following, with non-compliance rates notably higher than in information querying; 3) Code quality optimization and requirements-driven development tasks show lower user satisfaction, whereas structured knowledge queries and algorithm designs yield higher levels. These insights offer recommendations for improving LLM interfaces and user satisfaction in coding collaborations, while highlighting avenues for future research on adaptive dialogue systems.

However, existing Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) exhibit structural limitations in this setting: inflated local groups increase single-node repair cost, multi-node failures frequently trigger expensive global repair, and reliability degrades sharply. We identify a key root cause: local and global parity blocks are designed independently, preventing them from cooperating during repair. We present Cascaded Parity LRCs (CP-LRCs), a new family of wide stripe LRCs that embed structured dependency between parity blocks by decomposing a global parity block across all local parity blocks. This creates a cascaded parity group that preserves MDS-level fault tolerance while enabling low-bandwidth single-node and multi-node repairs. We provide a general coefficient-generation framework, develop repair algorithms exploiting cascading, and instantiate the design with CP-Azure and CP-Uniform.

Specifically, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have forced the community to focus on users' data privacy. Despite the vast amount of data on developer issues available in GitHub repositories, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the issues developers of Open Source Software discuss to comply with privacy legislation. Method: In this work, we examine such discussions by mining and analyzing 32,820 issues from GitHub repositories. We partially analyzed the dataset automatically to identify law user rights and principles indicated, and manually analyzed a sample of 1,186 issues based on the type of concern addressed. Results: We devised 24 discussion categories placed in six clusters: features/bugs, consent-related, documentation, data storing/sharing, adaptability, and general compliance. Our results show that developers mainly focus on specific user rights from the legislation (right to erasure, right to opt-out, right to access), addressing other rights less frequently, while most discussions concern user consent, user rights functionality, bugs and cookies management. Conclusion: The created taxonomy can help practitioners understand which issues are discussed for law compliance, so that they ensure they address them first in their systems. In addition, the educational community can reshape curricula to better educate future engineers on the privacy law concerns raised, and the research community can identify gaps and areas for improvement to support and accelerate data privacy law compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790GitHub\u4e0a\u768432,820\u4e2a\u8bae\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u9075\u5b88GDPR\u548cCCPA\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u65f6\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa24\u4e2a\u8ba8\u8bba\u7c7b\u522b\u5e76\u5f52\u4e3a\u516d\u5927\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u754c\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u754c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e94\u5bf9\u5408\u89c4\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u5982GDPR\u548cCCPA\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8c03\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90\u793e\u533a\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5206\u6790GitHub\u4e0a32,820\u4e2a\u8bae\u9898\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6743\u5229\u4e0e\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf91,186\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa\u516d\u5927\u7c7b\u517124\u4e2a\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6700\u5173\u6ce8\u7528\u6237\u5220\u9664\u6743\u3001\u9000\u51fa\u6743\u3001\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u53ca\u540c\u610f\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u7f3a\u9677\u4fee\u590d\u4e0eCookie\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u5408\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u754c\u53ef\u636e\u6b64\u4f18\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u754c\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u5408\u89c4\u8fdb\u7a0b\u3002"}}

By clustering clients and training cluster-specific models, CFL enables personalized models tailored to groups of heterogeneous clients. However, conventional CFL approaches suffer from fragmented learning for training independent global models for each cluster and fail to take advantage of collective cluster insights. This paper advocates a shift to hierarchical CFL, allowing bi-level aggregation to train cluster-specific models at the edge and a unified global model at the cloud. This shift improves training efficiency yet might introduce communication challenges. To this end, we propose CFLHKD, a novel personalization scheme for integrating hierarchical cluster knowledge into CFL. Built upon multi-teacher knowledge distillation, CFLHKD enables inter-cluster knowledge sharing while preserving cluster-specific personalization. CFLHKD adopts a bi-level aggregation to bridge the gap between local and global learning. Extensive evaluations of standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFLHKD outperforms representative baselines in cluster-specific and global model accuracy and achieves a performance improvement of 3.32-7.57\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "CFLHKD\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u7c7b\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u73873.32-7.57%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCFL\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u5404\u7c07\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u8de8\u7c07\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCFLHKD\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7c07\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCFLHKD\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7c07\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u63d0\u53473.32-7.57%\u3002", "conclusion": "CFLHKD\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although the overall throughput has improved greatly, the Decode-stage of PD disaggregation remains to be a major bottleneck. This bottleneck primarily stems from the conflict between linear growth of Latent-Cache with sequence length and the limited GPU memory capacity, which constrains the feasible batch-size and thereby suppresses Decode-stage throughput.\n  To address this challenge, we propose ESS (Extended Sparse Server), an offload-centric system design tailored for DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp. ESS selectively offloads Latent-Cache to CPU memory while preserving latency-critical components on GPU. By freeing up GPU memory, ESS effectively decoupling batch-size scaling from GPU memory constraints. This design significantly improves Decode-stage throughput, thereby reducing deployment costs in real-world settings.\n  Our high-fidelity simulations show that ESS delivers 69.4\\% throughput improvement at 32K context length and up to 123\\% throughput improvement at 128K, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-context inference workloads.
