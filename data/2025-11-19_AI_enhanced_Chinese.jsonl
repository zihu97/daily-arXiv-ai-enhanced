With this change of paradigm, we remove many restrictions previously enforced to allow provable performance. Most notability, while maintaining the core behaviour of GCS, we: 1. Lift the requirement for unitary link lengths and thereby create a realistic model for flexible deployment of implementations of GCS in practice. 2. Provide a formal model of frequency sources assumed in prior work. 3. Perform a fine grained distinction between the different components of the algorithm's estimation error and globally reduce its impact by multiple orders of magnitude. 4. Significantly reduce the contribution of the uncertainty to the algorithm's estimation error to be in the range of 10\\% to 0,1\\% of the delay per link instead of being in the oder of the delay per link as in prior work and show matching upper bounds on the local and global skew of GCS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06GCS\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5355\u5411\u6d4b\u91cf\u8303\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6d4b\u91cf\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u653e\u5bbd\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5bf9\u94fe\u8def\u957f\u5ea6\u7b49\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8eGCS\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5411\u6d4b\u91cf\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u65bd\u52a0\u4e86\u8bf8\u591a\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff08\u5982\u5355\u4f4d\u94fe\u8def\u957f\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5411\u6d4b\u91cf\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06GCS\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5355\u5411\u6d4b\u91cf\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53cc\u5411\u6d4b\u91cf\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u91cd\u65b0\u5efa\u6a21\u9891\u7387\u6e90\u3001\u7ec6\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "1. \u53d6\u6d88\u4e86\u5355\u4f4d\u94fe\u8def\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7075\u6d3b\u90e8\u7f72\uff1b2. \u660e\u786e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u9690\u542b\u7684\u9891\u7387\u6e90\u5047\u8bbe\uff1b3. \u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u4f53\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b4. \u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u964d\u81f3\u6bcf\u94fe\u8def\u5ef6\u8fdf\u76840.1%\u201310%\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u659c\u7684\u5339\u914d\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u6d4b\u91cf\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GCS\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5176\u65f6\u949f\u540c\u6b65\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

As these workloads run in heterogeneous environments such as the Edge-Cloud-Space 3D Continuum, they often require intensive parallel computation, which GPUs can perform far more efficiently than CPUs. However, current platforms struggle to manage hardware acceleration effectively, as static user-device assignments fail to ensure SLO compliance under varying loads or placements, and one-time dynamic selections often lead to suboptimal or cost-inefficient configurations. To address these issues, we present Gaia, a GPU-as-a-service model and architecture that makes hardware acceleration a platform concern. Gaia combines (i) a lightweight Execution Mode Identifier that inspects function code at deploy time to emit one of four execution modes, and a Dynamic Function Runtime that continuously reevaluates user-defined SLOs to promote or demote between CPU- and GPU backends. Our evaluation shows that it seamlessly selects the best hardware acceleration for the workload, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 95%. These results indicate that Gaia enables SLO-aware, cost-efficient acceleration for serverless AI across heterogeneous environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gaia is a GPU-as-a-service architecture for serverless AI that dynamically selects between CPU and GPU backends based on workload characteristics and SLOs, reducing latency by up to 95%.", "motivation": "Current serverless platforms lack effective mechanisms to manage hardware acceleration in heterogeneous environments like the Edge-Cloud-Space continuum, leading to poor SLO compliance and inefficient resource usage due to static or one-time dynamic device assignments.", "method": "Gaia introduces a lightweight Execution Mode Identifier that classifies functions into four execution modes at deploy time, and a Dynamic Function Runtime that continuously monitors and adjusts hardware backend (CPU/GPU) based on user-defined SLOs.", "result": "Gaia reduces end-to-end latency by up to 95% while maintaining SLO compliance and cost efficiency across heterogeneous computing environments.", "conclusion": "Gaia successfully makes hardware acceleration a platform-managed concern, enabling SLO-aware and cost-efficient execution of serverless AI workloads in dynamic, heterogeneous infrastructures."}}

Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD) offers high compression ratios with minimal accuracy loss, yet repeated singular value decompositions (SVDs) and matrix multiplications can impose significant latency and energy costs on low power processors. In this work, we present TT-Edge, a hardware software co designed framework aimed at overcoming these challenges. By splitting SVD into two phases--bidiagonalization and diagonalization--TT-Edge offloads the most compute intensive tasks to a specialized TTD Engine. This engine integrates tightly with an existing GEMM accelerator, thereby curtailing the frequent matrix vector transfers that often undermine system performance and energy efficiency. Implemented on a RISC-V-based edge AI processor, TT-Edge achieves a 1.7x speedup compared to a GEMM only baseline when compressing a ResNet 32 model via TTD, while reducing overall energy usage by 40.2 percent. These gains come with only a 4 percent increase in total power and minimal hardware overhead, enabled by a lightweight design that reuses GEMM resources and employs a shared floating point unit. Our experimental results on both FPGA prototypes and post-synthesis power analysis at 45 nm demonstrate that TT-Edge effectively addresses the latency and energy bottlenecks of TTD based compression in edge environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTT-Edge\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u5217\u5206\u89e3\uff08TTD\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5173\u952e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6548\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f20\u91cf\u5217\u5206\u89e3\uff08TTD\uff09\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\uff08SVD\uff09\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "TT-Edge\u5c06SVD\u5206\u4e3a\u53cc\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u90e8\u5206\u5378\u8f7d\u81f3\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684TTD\u5f15\u64ce\u3002\u8be5\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684GEMM\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7d27\u5bc6\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u77e9\u9635-\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u65b9\u6848\u5728RISC-V\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u590d\u7528GEMM\u8d44\u6e90\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u6d6e\u70b9\u5355\u5143\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728FPGA\u539f\u578b\u548c45nm\u5de5\u827a\u4e0b\u7684\u540e\u7efc\u5408\u529f\u8017\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cTT-Edge\u5728\u5bf9ResNet-32\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884cTTD\u538b\u7f29\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528GEMM\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.7\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c40.2%\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u589e\u52a04%\u7684\u603b\u529f\u8017\u548c\u6781\u5c11\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "TT-Edge\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86TTD\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Emerging open GPU architectures define SIMT functionality through their own ISAs, but executing existing GPU programs and optimizing performance on these ISAs relies on a compiler framework that is technically complex and often undercounted in open hardware development costs.\n  To address this challenge, the Vortex-Optimized Lightweight Toolchain (VOLT) has been proposed. This paper presents its design principles, overall structure, and the key compiler transformations required to support SIMT execution on Vortex. VOLT enables SIMT code generation and optimization across multiple levels of abstraction through a hierarchical design that accommodates diverse front-end languages and open GPU hardware. To ensure extensibility as GPU architectures evolve, VOLT centralizes fundamental SIMT-related analyses and optimizations in the middle-end, allowing them to be reused across front-ends and easily adapted to emerging open-GPU variants. Through two case studies on ISA extensions and host-runtime API, this paper also demonstrates how VOLT can support extensions", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Vortex\u4f18\u5316\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff08VOLT\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u6e90GPU\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684SIMT\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u524d\u7aef\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6838\u5fc3SIMT\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u4e2d\u7aef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u6e90GPU\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u652f\u6301\u73b0\u6709GPU\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u5f00\u6e90ISA\u4e0a\u7684\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u5e38\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86VOLT\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u7aef\u96c6\u4e2d\u5904\u7406SIMT\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u524d\u7aef\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u5f00\u6e90GPU\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\uff08ISA\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u4e3b\u673a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6API\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "VOLT\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684SIMT\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u65b0ISA\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u826f\u597d\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90GPU\u751f\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u3001\u6613\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "VOLT\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90GPU\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u6e90GPU\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6808\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u751f\u6001\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we make use of the Reference Broadcast Infrastructure Synchronization protocol, which leverages the broadcast nature of wireless communications and remains both non-invasive and standard-compliant. We implement and validate this protocol on a low-cost testbed using ESP32 modules and a commercial Wi-Fi access point.

Under review", "summary": "Language models generate functionally correct code that tends toward excessive verbosity, with elaborate documentation and defensive patterns that diverge from human baselines. Two prompting mechanisms have emerged for stylistic control: instruction based prompts that articulate abstract directives, and example based prompts that provide concrete code demonstrations. The core problem is whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial implementations with additional features while maintaining high functional accuracy. Here we show that instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts produce distinct patterns of initial control and expansion discipline over one enhancement turn. We manipulated system prompts across four conditions in a paired two-turn protocol where models first generated solutions to an intermediate Python task, then revised their code under general improvement directives, holding the user task fixed (N = 160 paired programs). Combined prompts produced the strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects and moderate expansion discipline. Examples showed modest initial effects with no expansion discipline. These results show that initial prompt effectiveness and expansion discipline are separate aspects of prompt design, and that combined approaches provide the most stable stylistic control in this two-turn workflow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u6307\u4ee4\u578b\u3001\u793a\u4f8b\u578b\u53ca\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\uff09\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u589e\u5f3a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u98ce\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u867d\u7136\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5197\u957f\uff0c\u504f\u79bb\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u662f\u672c\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u4e24\u8f6e\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u6307\u4ee4\u578b\u3001\u793a\u4f8b\u578b\u3001\u7ed3\u5408\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff09\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4Python\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u518d\u6839\u636e\u901a\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u6307\u4ee4\u4fee\u8ba2\u4ee3\u7801\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u53d8\uff09\uff0c\u5171\u6536\u96c6160\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u6027\uff1b\u6307\u4ee4\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u521d\u59cb\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4f46\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u6027\u4e2d\u7b49\uff1b\u793a\u4f8b\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u521d\u59cb\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u65e0\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u521d\u59cb\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u7eaa\u5f8b\u6027\u662f\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u4e24\u8f6e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

These challenges hinder scalable and accurate IMC acceleration as models grow.\n  We propose NL-DPE, a Non-Linear Dot Product Engine that overcomes these barriers. NL-DPE augments crosspoint arrays with RRAM-based Analog Content Addressable Memory (ACAM) to execute arbitrary non-linear functions and data-dependent matrix multiplications in the analog domain by transforming them into decision trees, fully eliminating ADCs. To address device noise, NL-DPE uses software-based Noise Aware Fine-tuning (NAF), requiring no in-device calibration.

While it helps students navigate programming challenges, its use also raises concerns about academic integrity and overreliance. Despite growing interest in this topic, prior research has largely relied on surveys, emphasizing trends over in-depth analysis of students' strategies and ethical awareness. This study complements existing work through a qualitative investigation of how computer science students in one UK institution strategically and ethically engage with ChatGPT in software development projects. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, it explores two key questions: How do computer science students ethically and strategically report using ChatGPT in software development projects? How do students understand and perceive the ethical issues associated with using ChatGPT in academic and professional contexts? Findings reveal a shift in students' learning models, moving from traditional \"independent thinking-manual coding-iterative debugging\" to \"AI-assisted ideation-interactive programming-collaborative optimization.\" Importantly, many use ChatGPT conversationally to deepen understanding, while consciously reserving creative and high-level decision-making tasks for themselves. Students tend to cap ChatGPT's contribution to roughly 30%, and evaluate its output to mitigate overreliance. However, only a minority thoroughly analyze AI-generated code, raising concerns about reduced critical engagement. Meanwhile, students reject uncredited use, highlight risks such as privacy breaches and skill degradation, and call for clear usage guidelines set by their teachers. This research offers novel insights into the evolving learner-AI dynamic and highlights the need for explicit guidance to support responsible and pedagogically sound use of such tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d28\u6027\u8bbf\u8c08\u63a2\u8ba8\u82f1\u56fd\u67d0\u9ad8\u6821\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e13\u4e1a\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u4e14\u5408\u4e4e\u4f26\u7406\u5730\u4f7f\u7528ChatGPT\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u751f\u666e\u904d\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u8d21\u732e\u7ea630%\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u521b\u9020\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u6559\u5e08\u5236\u5b9a\u660e\u786e\u4f7f\u7528\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1ChatGPT\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5b66\u751f\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u5730\u4f7f\u7528ChatGPT\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u5bf9\u4e00\u6240\u82f1\u56fd\u9ad8\u6821\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u8d28\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u5176\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528ChatGPT\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ece\u201c\u72ec\u7acb\u601d\u8003\u2014\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u2014\u8fed\u4ee3\u8c03\u8bd5\u201d\u8f6c\u5411\u201cAI\u8f85\u52a9\u6784\u601d\u2014\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7f16\u7a0b\u2014\u534f\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u201d\uff1b\u591a\u6570\u5b66\u751f\u5c06ChatGPT\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9636\u51b3\u7b56\u6743\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u8d21\u732e\u7ea630%\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b\u4f46\u4ec5\u5c11\u6570\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790AI\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u51cf\u5f31\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u5b66\u751f\u666e\u904d\u53cd\u5bf9\u672a\u6ce8\u660e\u51fa\u5904\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u4e0e\u6280\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u6307\u5f15\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u4e0eAI\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u6307\u5bfc\u4fc3\u8fdbChatGPT\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u6559\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

This hardware shift has sparked a new line of algorithm research: using low-precision units to emulate double-precision accuracy through schemes such as Ozaki decompositions. We advance this direction with Automatic Dynamic Precision (ADP), a fully GPU-resident framework that makes emulated FP64 matrix multiplication both efficient and reliable. At its core is the Exponent Span Capacity (ESC), a hardware-agnostic estimator that conservatively determines the decomposition parameter (also known as slices) required to achieve FP64-level accuracy. Built on ESC, ADP integrates exception handling, run time heuristics, and seamless fallback to native FP64, ensuring correctness without host-device synchronization or user intervention. Additionally, we further improve Ozaki-style decompositions with an unsigned integer slicing scheme, which increases representational efficiency and reduces computational waste. Validated against recently proposed BLAS grading tests, ADP consistently preserves FP64 fidelity on challenging inputs while incurring less than 10% run time overhead. In a 55-bit mantissa setting, our approach achieves up to 2.3x and 13.2x speedups over native FP64 GEMM on NVIDIA Blackwell GB200 and the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Server Edition, respectively.

This is because existing methods focus on topological structures rather than comprehensive semantic characteristics of Autonomous Systems (ASes), often misinterpreting functionally similar but topologically distant ASes.\n  To address this, we propose BGPShield, an anomaly detection framework built on LLM embeddings that captures the Behavior Portrait and Routing Policy Rationale of each AS beyond topology, such as operational scale and global role.

We introduce \\textbf{LoCoBench-Agent}, a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLM agents in realistic, long-context software engineering workflows. Our framework extends LoCoBench's 8,000 scenarios into interactive agent environments, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-turn conversations, tool usage efficiency, error recovery, and architectural consistency across extended development sessions. We also introduce an evaluation methodology with 9 metrics across comprehension and efficiency dimensions. Our framework provides agents with 8 specialized tools (file operations, search, code analysis) and evaluates them across context lengths ranging from 10K to 1M tokens, enabling precise assessment of long-context performance. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we reveal several key findings: (1) agents exhibit remarkable long-context robustness; (2) comprehension-efficiency trade-off exists with negative correlation, where thorough exploration increases comprehension but reduces efficiency; and (3) conversation efficiency varies dramatically across models, with strategic tool usage patterns differentiating high-performing agents.

Existing communication systems only support parallel transmissions at the bit level, which fundamentally limits the number of tasks that can be concurrently processed. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces the new concept of Semantic Multiplexing. Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically repairing flaky tests, existing approaches like FlakyDoctor fail in industrial settings due to the context problem: providing either too little context (missing critical production code) or too much context (overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant information). We present FlakyGuard, which addresses this problem by treating code as a graph structure and using selective graph exploration to find only the most relevant context. Evaluation on real-world flaky tests from industrial repositories shows that FlakyGuard repairs 47.6 % of reproducible flaky tests with 51.8 % of the fixes accepted by developers. Besides it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by at least 22 % in repair success rate.

A Single-Node Cross-Implementation Study on Shared-Memory Communication", "comment": "9 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "MPI's derived datatypes (DDTs) promise easier, copy-free communication of non-contiguous data, yet their practical performance remains debated and is often reported only for a single MPI stack. We present a cross-implementation assessment using three 2D applications: a Jacobi CFD solver, Conway's Game of Life, and a lattice-based image reconstruction. Each application is written in two ways: (i) a BASIC version with manual packing and unpacking of non-contiguous regions and (ii) a DDT version using MPI_Type_vector and MPI_Type_create_subarray with correct true extent via MPI_Type_create_resized. For API parity, we benchmark identical communication semantics: non-blocking point-to-point (Irecv/Isend + Waitall), neighborhood collectives (MPI_Neighbor_alltoallw), and MPI-4 persistent operations (*_init). We run strong and weak scaling on 1-4 ranks, validate bitwise-identical halos, and evaluate four widely used MPI implementations: MPICH, Open MPI, Intel MPI, and MVAPICH2 on a single ARCHER2 node. Results are mixed. DDTs can be fastest, for example for the image reconstruction code on Intel MPI and MPICH, but can also be among the slowest on other stacks, such as Open MPI and MVAPICH2 for the same code. For the CFD solver, BASIC variants generally outperform DDTs across semantics, whereas for Game of Life the ranking flips depending on the MPI library. We also observe stack-specific anomalies, for example MPICH slowdowns with DDT neighborhood and persistent modes. Overall, no strategy dominates across programs, semantics, and MPI stacks; performance portability for DDTs is not guaranteed. We therefore recommend profiling both DDT-based and manual-packing designs under the intended MPI implementation and communication mode.

A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters.

Existing systems mitigate this through compute-communication overlap but often fail to meet theoretical peak performance across heterogeneous workloads and new accelerators. Instead of operator-specific techniques, we ask whether a small set of simple, reusable principles can systematically guide the design of optimal multi-GPU kernels. We present ParallelKittens (PK), a minimal CUDA framework that drastically simplifies the development of overlapped multi-GPU kernels. PK extends the ThunderKittens framework and embodies the principles of multi-GPU kernel design through eight core primitives and a unified programming template, derived from a comprehensive analysis of the factors that govern multi-GPU performance$\\unicode{x2014}$data-transfer mechanisms, resource scheduling, and design overheads. We validate PK on both Hopper and Blackwell architectures.

Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLogPurge\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u89c4\u5219\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u51c0\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b97\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u542b\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u6b63\u5e38\u5b50\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e72\u51c0\u65e0\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u83b7\u53d6\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u6e05\u6d17\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u7ed3\u5408\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLogPurge\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u53bb\u9664\u805a\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u5219\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5bf9\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u5269\u4f59\u6c61\u67d3\u533a\u57df\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u66f4\u5c0f\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u5e94\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u51c0\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u53bb\u966498.74%\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4fdd\u755982.39%\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u65b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65e5\u5fd7\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0cF-1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534735.7%\u300184.11%\u548c149.72%\u3002", "conclusion": "LogPurge\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u51c0\u5316\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

FailSafe introduces three techniques to balance computation and memory across GPUs: (1) Cyclic KVCache Placement for uniform memory utilization, (2) Hybrid Attention combining tensor- and data-parallel attention to eliminate stragglers, and (3) Fine-Grained Load-Aware Routing to dynamically balance requests. It further employs proactive KVCache backup and on-demand weight recovery to avoid expensive recomputation and redundant data transfers. We implement these techniques in a lightweight serving engine compatible with existing LLM infrastructures. Evaluated on an 8xH100 DGX system with real-world fault traces and representative workloads, FailSafe achieves up to 2x higher throughput and two orders of magnitude lower recovery latency compared to standard fault handling approaches. Even with up to three GPU failures, FailSafe sustains high throughput and balanced utilization, demonstrating robust and efficient LLM serving under dynamic and unreliable hardware conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "FailSafe \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5bb9\u9519\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\uff08TP\uff09\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af KVCache \u653e\u7f6e\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5728 GPU \u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6062\u590d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347 LLM \u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u5355\u70b9 GPU \u6545\u969c\u4f1a\u4e2d\u65ad\u6267\u884c\u3001\u5f15\u53d1\u6602\u8d35\u7684 KVCache \u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u9020\u6210\u957f\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5931\u8861\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219 GPU \u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "FailSafe \u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a(1) \u5faa\u73af KVCache \u653e\u7f6e\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5747\u5300\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\uff1b(2) \u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u884c\u6d88\u9664\u62d6\u5c3e\u6548\u5e94\uff1b(3) \u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8 KVCache \u5907\u4efd\u4e0e\u6309\u9700\u6743\u91cd\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u670d\u52a1\u5f15\u64ce\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728 8xH100 DGX \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6545\u969c\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5178\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cFailSafe \u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5bb9\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347 2 \u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6700\u591a\u4e09\u5757 GPU \u6545\u969c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5747\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "FailSafe \u80fd\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684 LLM \u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002"}}

This study presents an empirically validated Scrum-based Agile framework tailored for DO-178C compliant, safety-critical aerospace software. The framework adapts core Scrum roles, artifacts, and events to meet certification, verification, and independence objectives. Key enhancements include a multi-disciplinary product ownership model, dual compliance-and-functionality acceptance criteria, independent testing and documentation teams, and dedicated certification liaisons. The approach was evaluated through two comparable aerospace projects-one using the customized Agile process and the other a traditional Waterfall model. Results showed significant improvements: a 76% reduction in Total Effort per Requirement, 75% faster Defect Detection, 78% faster Defect Resolution, and over 50% lower Defect Density, while maintaining full compliance with DO-178C Design Assurance Level A. These findings demonstrate that Agile practices and regulatory compliance can coexist effectively when supported by disciplined tailoring and proactive engagement with certification authorities. The study also notes challenges, including increased V&V effort due to recurring Sprint activities and refactoring inherent to iterative development. Nonetheless, it identifies substantial opportunities for further gains through workflow automation, CI/CD practices, and automated documentation, verification, and configuration management. Future research should expand validation of this framework across the aerospace domain and other safety-critical industries with similar certification requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3aDO-178C\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9a\u5236\u7684Scrum\u654f\u6377\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u654f\u6377\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u53ca\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8981\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u654f\u6377\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u6ee1\u8db3DO-178C\u7b49\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u3001\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u654f\u6377\u6027\u53c8\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684Scrum\u654f\u6377\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574Scrum\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u5de5\u4ef6\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6765\u6ee1\u8db3DO-178C\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u589e\u5f3a\u63aa\u65bd\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u4ea7\u54c1\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u53cc\u91cd\u9a8c\u6536\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u6587\u6863\u56e2\u961f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e13\u804c\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8054\u7edc\u4eba\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u9879\u76ee\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u654f\u6377\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u91c7\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u7011\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u7011\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u654f\u6377\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u603b\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1176%\uff0c\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb75%\uff0c\u7f3a\u9677\u89e3\u51b3\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb78%\uff0c\u7f3a\u9677\u5bc6\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc750%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b8c\u5168\u7b26\u5408DO-178C\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7b49\u7ea7A\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u7eaa\u5f8b\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u548c\u4e0e\u8ba4\u8bc1\u673a\u6784\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u654f\u6377\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0e\u6cd5\u89c4\u9075\u4ece\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5171\u5b58\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u786e\u8ba4\uff08V&V\uff09\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001CI/CD\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6587\u6863\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4ecd\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5c06\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u9886\u57df\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u884c\u4e1a\u3002"}}

While GPU memory offloading to CPU and NVMe has made large-scale training more feasible, existing approaches suffer from high tensor migration latency and suboptimal device memory utilization, ultimately increasing training time and cloud costs. To address these challenges, we present 10Cache, a resource-aware tensor caching and migration system that accelerates LLM training by intelligently coordinating memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe tiers. 10Cache profiles tensor execution order to construct prefetch policies, allocates memory buffers in pinned memory based on tensor size distributions, and reuses memory buffers to minimize allocation overhead.\n  Designed for cloud-scale deployments, 10Cache improves memory efficiency and reduces reliance on high-end GPUs. Across diverse LLM workloads, it achieves up to 2x speedup in training time, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases CPU/GPU memory utilization by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art offloading methods. These results demonstrate that 10Cache is a practical and scalable solution for optimizing LLM training throughput and resource efficiency in cloud environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "10Cache \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u5f20\u91cf\u7f13\u5b58\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316 GPU\u3001CPU \u548c NVMe \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u534f\u540c\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34 GPU \u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5185\u5b58\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5f20\u91cf\u8fc1\u79fb\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u957f\u548c\u4e91\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u3002", "method": "10Cache \u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f20\u91cf\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u6309\u5f20\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u914d\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u7528\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u914d\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u667a\u80fd\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u7ea7\u5b58\u50a8\uff08GPU/CPU/NVMe\uff09\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\uff0c10Cache \u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347 2 \u500d\uff0cGPU \u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347 86.6 \u500d\uff0cCPU \u548c GPU \u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u5206\u522b\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347 2.15 \u500d\u548c 1.33 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "10Cache \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7aef GPU \u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

This paper presents KTester, a novel framework that integrates project-specific knowledge and testing domain knowledge to enhance LLM-based test generation. Our approach first extracts project structure and usage knowledge through static analysis, which provides rich context for the model. It then employs a testing-domain-knowledge-guided separation of test case design and test method generation, combined with a multi-perspective prompting strategy that guides the LLM to consider diverse testing heuristics. The generated tests follow structured templates, improving clarity and maintainability. We evaluate KTester on multiple open-source projects, comparing it against state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines using automatic correctness and coverage metrics, as well as a human study assessing readability and maintainability. Results demonstrate that KTester significantly outperforms existing methods across six key metrics, improving execution pass rate by 5.69% and line coverage by 8.83% over the strongest baseline, while requiring less time and generating fewer test cases.

While applying FL in cross-silo scenarios, where organizations collaborate, it is necessary that the FL system is reliable; however, participants can fail due to various reasons (e.g., communication issues or misconfigurations). In order to provide a reliable system, it is necessary to analyze the impact of participant failures. While this problem received attention in cross-device FL where mobile devices with limited resources participate, there is comparatively little research in cross-silo FL.\n  Therefore, we conduct an extensive study for analyzing the impact of participant failures on the model quality in the context of inter-organizational cross-silo FL with few participants. In our study, we focus on analyzing generally influential factors such as the impact of the timing and the data as well as the impact on the evaluation, which is important for deciding, if the model should be deployed. We show that under high skews the evaluation is optimistic and hides the real impact. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the timing impacts the quality of the trained model.

The rollout phase, which dominates end-to-end iteration time, suffers from substantial long-tail latency and poor resource utilization due to inherent workload imbalance. We present Seer, a novel online context learning system that addresses these challenges by exploiting previously overlooked similarities in output lengths and generation patterns among requests sharing the same prompt. Seer introduces three key techniques: divided rollout for dynamic load balancing, context-aware scheduling, and adaptive grouped speculative decoding. Together, these mechanisms substantially reduce long-tail latency and improve resource efficiency during rollout. Evaluations on production-grade RL workloads demonstrate that Seer improves end-to-end rollout throughput by 74% to 97% and reduces long-tail latency by 75% to 93% compared to state-of-the-art synchronous RL systems, significantly accelerating RL training iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Seer \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8bf7\u6c42\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5 rollout\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7ec4\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d rollout \u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u957f\u5c3e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540c\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728 rollout \u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u957f\u5c3e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Seer \u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u9636\u6bb5 rollout \u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u7ec4\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316 rollout \u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cSeer \u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u540c\u6b65 RL \u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef rollout \u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347 74%\u201397%\uff0c\u957f\u5c3e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e 75%\u201393%\u3002", "conclusion": "Seer \u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86 rollout \u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Using this framework, FHIRconnect successfully mapped 24 international archetypes to 15 FHIR profiles across seven clinical domains. Key contributions include the first comprehensive DSL for openEHR-FHIR transformation with a formal specification, an open-source execution engine (openFHIR), and an accessible mapping library covering high-impact clinical archetypes. Together, these components establish the technical basis for community-driven mapping standardization, reducing reliance on custom ETL solutions and advancing syntactic and semantic interoperability in healthcare IT systems built on open standards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFHIRconnect\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eopenEHR\u4e0eHL7 FHIR\u4e4b\u95f4\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u53cc\u5411\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff08DSL\uff09\u53ca\u5f00\u6e90\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b065%\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8986\u76d624\u4e2a\u56fd\u9645\u539f\u578b\u4e0e15\u4e2aFHIR\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eopenEHR\u4e0eHL7 FHIR\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff08DSL\uff09\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6c\u6362\u5f15\u64ce\uff08openFHIR\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fd\u9645\u539f\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u5b9a\u5236\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210openEHR\u4e0eFHIR\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c0624\u4e2a\u56fd\u9645\u539f\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u81f315\u4e2aFHIR\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e03\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b065%\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u590d\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u9996\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u7684openEHR-FHIR\u8f6c\u6362DSL\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u6267\u884c\u5f15\u64ce\u53ca\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4e34\u5e8a\u539f\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5e93\u3002", "conclusion": "FHIRconnect\u4e3a\u793e\u533a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u5b9a\u5236ETL\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u533b\u7597IT\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, simulation is critical to the success of the field and a requirement for algorithm development and validation, as well as hardware design. GPU-acceleration has become standard practice for simulation, and due to the exponential scaling inherent in classical methods, multi-GPU simulation can be required to achieve representative system sizes. In this case, inter-GPU communications can bottleneck performance. In this work, we present the introduction of MPI into the QED-C Application-Oriented Benchmarks to facilitate benchmarking on HPC systems. We review the advances in interconnect technology and the APIs for multi-GPU communication. We benchmark using a variety of interconnect paths, including the recent NVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72 architecture that represents the first product to expand high-bandwidth GPU-specialized interconnects across multiple nodes. We show that while improvements to GPU architecture have led to speedups of over 4.5X across the last few generations of GPUs, advances in interconnect performance have had a larger impact with over 16X performance improvements in time to solution for multi-GPU simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06MPI\u5f15\u5165QED-C\u5e94\u7528\u5bfc\u5411\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5728\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08HPC\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5bf9\u591aGPU\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4e92\u8fde\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5305\u62ecNVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e92\u8fde\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u591aGPU\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff0816\u500d\uff09\u8fdc\u8d85GPU\u67b6\u6784\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff084.5\u500d\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u968f\u7740\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u591aGPU\u6a21\u62df\u6210\u4e3a\u5fc5\u9700\uff0c\u800cGPU\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u591aGPU\u4e92\u8fde\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u5728QED-C\u5e94\u7528\u5bfc\u5411\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210MPI\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u4e92\u8fde\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u5305\u62ecNVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u591aGPU\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u9645GPU\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u4e92\u8fde\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6a21\u62df\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u4ee3GPU\u67b6\u6784\u5e26\u6765\u76844.5\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e92\u8fde\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u591aGPU\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5230\u89e3\uff08time to solution\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc716\u500d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u591aGPU\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e92\u8fde\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u6bd4\u5355\u4e2aGPU\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e92\u8fde\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews and employed the Gioia Methodology, an adapted grounded theory methodology from organizational behavior, to inductively derive taxonomies of motivations and challenges, and build the Exposure-Pursuit-Evaluation (EPE) Process Model. Our findings reveal that impactful early exposure triggers intrinsic motivations, while non-impactful exposure requires an extrinsic push (e.g., career/ personal goals, external validation). We identify curiosity and avoiding alternatives as a distinct educational drivers, and barriers to belonging as the only challenge persisting across education and career. Our findings show that career progression challenges (e.g., navigating the corporate world) constrain extrinsic fulfillment while technical training challenges, barriers to belonging and threats to motivation constrain intrinsic fulfillment. The theory shows how unmet motivations and recurring challenges influence persistence, career shifts, or departure from the field. Our results provide a grounded model for designing interventions that strengthen intrinsic fulfillment and reduce systemic barriers in SE education and practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc715\u6b21\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u548cGioia\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u52a8\u673a\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4f53\u4ece\u6559\u80b2\u5230\u804c\u4e1a\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u66b4\u9732-\u8ffd\u6c42-\u8bc4\u4f30\u201d\uff08EPE\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e2a\u4f53\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5230\u804c\u4e1a\u8fc7\u6e21\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u673a\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6b64\u52a8\u6001\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u752815\u6b21\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ec4\u7ec7\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684Gioia\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u7f16\u7684\u624e\u6839\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u5f52\u7eb3\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u673a\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acbEPE\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u63a5\u89e6\u6fc0\u53d1\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u5219\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\uff1b\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u548c\u89c4\u907f\u5176\u4ed6\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u6559\u80b2\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff1b\u5f52\u5c5e\u611f\u969c\u788d\u662f\u8d2f\u7a7f\u6559\u80b2\u4e0e\u804c\u4e1a\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u804c\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u6311\u6218\u9650\u5236\u5916\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u6280\u672f\u57f9\u8bad\u3001\u5f52\u5c5e\u969c\u788d\u548c\u52a8\u673a\u5a01\u80c1\u5219\u9650\u5236\u5185\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\uff1b\u672a\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u4e0e\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2a\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u575a\u6301\u3001\u8f6c\u5c97\u6216\u79bb\u5f00\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7684EPE\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u611f\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u969c\u788d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM \"agents\" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u9057\u7559Fortran\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u7684Kokkos C++\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5411GPU\u5f02\u6784\u67b6\u6784\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u5927\u91cf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u751fFortran\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edfFortran\u79d1\u5b66\u4ee3\u7801\u96be\u4ee5\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u624b\u52a8\u91cd\u5199\u4e3aKokkos\u7b49\u73b0\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\u8017\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23Fortran\u5185\u6838\u5230Kokkos C++\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u7f16\u8bd1\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u8c03\u8bd5\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u6210\u529f\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u5185\u6838\uff1b\u4ed8\u8d39\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT-5\uff09\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbFortran\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u690dKokkos\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Llama4-Maverick\uff09\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ea7\u51fa\u53ef\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u7684LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5728Fortran\u5230Kokkos\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9057\u7559\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8d85\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u663e\u4e86LLM\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
