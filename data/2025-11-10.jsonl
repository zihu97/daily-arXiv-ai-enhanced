While previous studies have provided\ncomprehensive evaluation of single-path solutions, the same level of detail is\nlacking when considering sets of paths. This paper emphasizes that the path\ncharacterization strongly depends on the properties under consideration. While\nproperty-based characterization is also valid for single paths, it becomes\ncrucial to analyse multiple path sets. From the above consideration, this paper\nproposes a mathematical approach, defining a functional model that lends itself\nwell to characterizing the path set in its general formulation. The paper shows\nhow the functional model contextualizes specific attributes."}

From this trend arises the need for\nhigh-performance hardware exhibiting predictable timing behavior. While\nstate-of-the-art real-time hardware often suffers from limited memory and\ncompute resources, modern AI accelerators typically lack the crucial\npredictability due to memory interference.\n  We present a new hardware architecture to bridge this gap between performance\nand predictability. The architecture features a multi-core vector processor\nwith predictable cores, each equipped with local scratchpad memories. A central\nmanagement core orchestrates access to shared external memory following a\nstatically determined schedule.\n  To evaluate the proposed hardware architecture, we analyze different variants\nof our parameterized design. We compare these variants to a baseline\narchitecture consisting of a single-core vector processor with large vector\nregisters. We find that configurations with a larger number of smaller cores\nachieve better performance due to increased effective memory bandwidth and\nhigher clock frequencies. Crucially for real-time systems, execution time\nfluctuation remains very low, demonstrating the platform's time predictability."}

In this\ncontext, previous works highlighted the importance of ensuring efficient and\nresilient communication for the underlying consensus and replication\nmechanisms. However, they were mainly focused on mainstream,\nProof-of-Work-based Distributed Ledger Technologies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n  In this paper, the problem is investigated in the context of\nconsensus-validation based blockchains, like the XRP Ledger. The latter relies\non a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) consensus mechanism which is proven to\nhave a good scalability in regards to transaction throughput. However, it is\nknown that significant increases in the size of the XRP Ledger network would be\nchallenging to achieve. The main reason is the flooding mechanism used to\ndisseminate the messages related to the consensus protocol, which creates many\nduplicates in the network.

This evolution have led these systems to\nincorporate high-speed networks using faster links, end nodes using multiple\nand dedicated accelerators, or a advancements in memory technologies to bridge\nthe memory bottleneck. The interconnection network is a key element in these\nsystems and it must be thoroughly designed so it is not the bottleneck of the\nentire system, bearing in mind the countless communication operations that\ngenerate current applications and services. Congestion is serious threat that\nspoils the interconnection network performance, and its effects are even more\ndramatic when looking at the traffic dynamics and bottlenecks generated by the\ncommunication operations mentioned above. In this vein, numerous congestion\ncontrol (CC) techniques have been developed to address congestion negative\neffects. One popular example is Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification\n(DCQCN), which allows congestion detection at network switch buffers, then\nmarking congesting packets and notifying about congestion to the sources, which\nfinally apply injection throttling of those packets contributing to congestion.\nWhile DCQCN has been widely studied and improved, its main principles for\ncongestion detection, notification and reaction remain largely unchanged, which\nis an important shortcoming considering congestion dynamics in current\nhigh-performance interconnection networks. In this paper, we revisit the DCQCN\nclosed-loop mechanism and refine its design to leverage a more accurate\ncongestion detection, signaling, and injection throttling, reducing control\ntraffic overhead and avoiding unnecessary throttling of non-congesting flows."}

We compare our results with lists of active\nIPv6 nodes obtained from prior methods and with random probing. Our findings\nindicate that probing an SRA address reveals on average 10% more router IP\naddresses than random probing and is far less affected by ICMP rate limiting.\nCompared to targeting router addresses directly, SRA probing discovers 80% more\naddresses.

To address these\nchallenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as\na method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a\nsmaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree\nto which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal\nrepresentations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current\naccuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality\nand often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity\nbetween the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically\nshow that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model,\nresulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks,\nwhich is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we\npropose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically\nevaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student\nmodels under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate\nMetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular\nlanguage models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation\ntechniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress\nidentifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring\nthe need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation\npipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing\ncompressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation."}
