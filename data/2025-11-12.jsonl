However, GNN training often relies on expensive, high-performance computing platforms, limiting accessibility for many tasks. Profiling of representative GNN workloads indicates that substantial efficiency gains are possible on resource-constrained devices by fully exploiting available resources. This paper introduces A3GNN, a framework for affordable, adaptive, and automatic GNN training on heterogeneous CPU-GPU platforms. It improves resource usage through locality-aware sampling and fine-grained parallelism scheduling. Moreover, it leverages reinforcement learning to explore the design space and achieve pareto-optimal trade-offs among throughput, memory footprint, and accuracy. Experiments show that A3GNN can bridge the performance gap, allowing seven Nvidia 2080Ti GPUs to outperform two A100 GPUs by up to 1.8X in throughput with minimal accuracy loss."}

Deploying these massive models is a complex distributed systems challenge constrained by memory bandwidth, computational throughput, and latency requirements. LLM inference fundamentally requires solving a multi objective optimization problem to minimize latency, maximize throughput, and reduce cost. This paper explores the necessary architectural shift towards disaggregated inference, which applies distributed systems principles such as service decomposition, resource disaggregation, and workload partitioning to overcome the limitations of traditional monolithic GPU clusters. By decoupling the compute intensive prefill phase from the memory intensive decode phase into independently scalable components, this paradigm mitigates resource contention and enables independent optimization of key metrics like Time to First Token and Inter Token Latency."}

While bringing enhanced intelligence to mobile ends, their deployment suffers from a set of performance challenges, especially the generation quality degradation and prolonged latency. Prior works have mainly relied on solutions of cloud offloading or on-device Small Language Models (SLMs). However, the former is usually limited by the communication bottleneck, and the latter sacrifices generation quality due to resource constraints. To mitigate these limitations, this paper proposes Synera, a device-cloud synergistic LLM serving system that applies an efficient SLM-LLM synergistic mechanism. Through empirical studies on LLM's unique computing characteristics, Synera identifies a set of underexplored optimization opportunities in device-cloud synergistic LLM inference, including offloading decisions, pipeline stalls, and batching bottlenecks. To translate them into enhanced performance, Synera introduces tailored designs of communication-efficient selective offloading, stall-free parallel inference, and scalable cloud batching. Extensive evaluations with real-world testbeds show that Synera enables 1.20-5.47x better generation quality against competitive baselines with on-par latency performance. Compared with existing cloud serving, Synera achieves 8.2-16.5% lower cloud serving cost on various benchmarks."}

To better understand and mitigate these risks, we present one of the first provider-internal, practice-based analysis of LLM inference incidents. We developed a taxonomy and methodology grounded in a year of operational experience, validating it on 156 high-severity incidents, and conducted a focused quantitative study of Apr-Jun 2025 to ensure recency and relevance. Our approach achieves high labeling consistency (Cohen's K ~0.89), identifies dominant failure modes (in our dataset ~60% inference engine failures, within that category ~40% timeouts), and surfaces mitigation levers (~74% auto-detected; ~28% required hotfix). Beyond hotfixes, many incidents were mitigated via traffic routing, node rebalancing, or capacity increase policies, indicating further automation opportunities. We also show how the taxonomy guided targeted strategies such as connection liveness, GPU capacity-aware routing, and per-endpoint isolation and reduced incident impact and accelerated recovery. Finally, we contribute a practitioner-oriented adoption checklist that enables others to replicate our taxonomy, analysis, and automation opportunities in their own systems.

Point-based neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in point cloud analysis, originally targeting small-scale inputs.

Existing accelerators, primarily optimized for small-scale workloads, overlook this challenge and scale poorly due to inefficient partitioning and non-parallel architectures. To address these issues, we propose FractalCloud, a fractal-inspired hardware architecture for efficient large-scale 3D point cloud processing. FractalCloud introduces two key optimizations: (1) a co-designed Fractal method for shape-aware and hardware-friendly partitioning, and (2) block-parallel point operations that decompose and parallelize all point operations. A dedicated hardware design with on-chip fractal and flexible parallelism further enables fully parallel processing within limited memory resources. Implemented in 28 nm technology as a chip layout with a core area of 1.5 $mm^2$, FractalCloud achieves 21.7x speedup and 27x energy reduction over state-of-the-art accelerators while maintaining network accuracy, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency for PNN inference."}

However, ROS 2's publish/subscribe API leaves DAG precedence constraints unenforced: a callback may publish mid-execution, and multi-input callbacks let developers choose topic-matching policies. Thus preserving DAG semantics relies on conventions; once violated, the model collapses. We propose the Function-as-Subtask (FasS) API, which expresses each subtask as a function whose arguments/return values are the subtask's incoming/outgoing edges. By minimizing description freedom, DAG semantics is guaranteed at the API rather than by programmer discipline. We implement a DAG-native scheduler using FasS on a Rust-based experimental kernel and evaluate its semantic fidelity, and we outline design guidelines for applying FasS to Linux Linux sched_ext."}

Tiered memory architectures provide a cost-effective solution but introduce challenges in embedding-vector placement due to complex embedding-access patterns. We propose RecMG, a machine learning (ML)-guided system for vector caching and prefetching on tiered memory. RecMG accurately predicts accesses to embedding vectors with long reuse distances or few reuses. The design of RecMG focuses on making ML feasible in the context of DLRM inference by addressing unique challenges in data labeling and navigating the search space for embedding-vector placement. By employing separate ML models for caching and prefetching, plus a novel differentiable loss function, RecMG narrows the prefetching search space and minimizes on-demand fetches. Compared to state-of-the-art temporal, spatial, and ML-based prefetchers, RecMG reduces on-demand fetches by 2.2x, 2.8x, and 1.5x, respectively. In industrial-scale DLRM inference scenarios, RecMG effectively reduces end-to-end DLRM inference time by up to 43%."}

We begin by formulating a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model that jointly considers throughput maximization and delay minimization between access points and IoT nodes under energy and link availability constraints. However, given the intractability of solving such NP-hard problems at scale and the impractical assumption of full channel observability, we propose the Dual-Graph Embedding with Transformer (DGET) framework, a supervised multi-task learning architecture combining a two-stage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a Transformer-based encoder. The first stage employs a transductive GNN that encodes the known graph topology and initial node and link states. The second stage introduces an inductive GNN for temporal refinement, which learns to generalize these embeddings to the evolved states of the same network, capturing changes in energy and queue dynamics over time, by aligning them with ground-truth scheduling decisions through a consistency loss. These enriched embeddings are then processed by a classifier for the communication links with a Transformer encoder that captures cross-link dependencies through multi-head self-attention via classification loss. Simulation results show that hybrid RF-OWC networks outperform standalone RF systems by handling higher traffic loads more efficiently and reducing the Age of Information (AoI) by up to 20%, all while maintaining comparable energy consumption. The proposed DGET framework, compared to traditional optimization-based methods, achieves near-optimal scheduling with over 90% classification accuracy, reduces computational complexity, and demonstrates higher robustness under partial channel observability."}

The adjustable hard settings of such systems require a flexible soft planning mechanism that enables realtime production planning and scheduling amid the existing complexity and variability in their configuration settings. This study explores the application of multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for dynamic scheduling in soft planning of the RMS settings. In the proposed framework, deep Qnetwork (DQN) agents trained in centralized training learn optimal job machine assignments in real time while adapting to stochastic events such as machine breakdowns and reconfiguration delays. The model also incorporates a negotiation with an attention mechanism to enhance state representation and improve decision focus on critical system features. Key DQN enhancements including prioritized experience replay, nstep returns, double DQN and soft target update are used to stabilize and accelerate learning. Experiments conducted in a simulated RMS environment demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline heuristics in reducing makespan and tardiness while improving machine utilization. The reconfigurable manufacturing environment was extended to simulate realistic challenges, including machine failures and reconfiguration times. Experimental results show that while the enhanced DQN agent is effective in adapting to dynamic conditions, machine breakdowns increase variability in key performance metrics such as makespan, throughput, and total tardiness. The results confirm the advantages of applying the MARL mechanism for intelligent and adaptive scheduling in dynamic reconfigurable manufacturing environments."}

To address this challenge, we propose PIMfused, a hardware-software co-design that enables fused-layer dataflow for end-to-end CNN execution in near-bank DRAM-PIM. By adopting fused-layer dataflow, PIMfused improves data reuse and, more importantly, breaks inter-bank data dependencies, thereby optimizing cross-bank data transfers without sacrificing bank-level parallelism. We study the impact of buffer sizes and PIMcore parallelism (1-bank vs. 4-bank) on PIMfused using end-to-end ResNet18. We present three key takeaways and show that with 4-bank PIMcores, PIMfused achieves overall PPA gains over a GDDR6-AiM-like baseline, cutting memory cycles to 30.6%, energy to 83.4%, and area to 76.5%."}

We present an exploratory empirical eye-tracking study to investigate 1) how developers classify the predominant paradigm in Python code and 2) how the paradigm affects their ability to debug Python code. The goal is to uncover if specific language features are looked at more often while classifying and debugging code with a predominant paradigm. Twenty-nine developers (primarily students) were recruited for the study and were each given four classification and four debugging tasks in Python. Eye movements were recorded during all the tasks. The results indicate confusion in labeling Functional and Procedural paradigms, but not Object-Oriented. The code with predominantly functional paradigms also took the longest to complete.

Our results show that intrinsic reasoning strength and group diversity are the dominant drivers of debate success, while structural parameters such as order or confidence visibility offer limited gains. Beyond outcomes, process-level analyses identify key behavioral patterns: majority pressure suppresses independent correction, effective teams overturn incorrect consensus, and rational, validity-aligned reasoning most strongly predicts improvement. These findings provide valuable insights into how and why LLM debates succeed or fail, offering guidance for designing interpretable and truth-seeking multi-agent reasoning systems."}

However, due to limited DRAM capacity, long-seuqence LLM decoding on smartphones is constrained by the key-value cache (KVCache), whose memory footprint increases linearly with sequence length. Retrieval-based methods mitigate DRAM pressure by offloading KVCache to flash and retrieving query-relevant entries through cluster-based indexing. Unfortunately, as decoding progresses, KVCache distribution shifts render static or local cluster updates progressively misaligned, excluding essential entries or fetching redundant ones. These issues are further exacerbated by smartphone-specific limitations in bandwidth, IOPS, and memory capacity.\n  We propose DynaKV, the first adaptive KVCache management approach that jointly addresses accuracy and efficiency for long-sequence decoding on smartphones. DynaKV integrates three key techniques: (1) Migration-Free Cluster Adaptation, which adaptively splits clusters during retrieval without incurring additional transfers; (2) Continuity-Centric Flash Management, which co-locates correlated entries and clusters and employs a dual-head layout for efficient updates; and (3) Memory-Efficient Cache Design, which virtualizes cache space across DRAM and flash and extends replacement policies to align with cluster-level access patterns. Evaluations demonstrate that DynaKV improves retrieval accuracy and reduces end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art solutions, achieving average gains of $1.38\\times$ in accuracy and $1.47\\times$ speedups. Furthermore, the insights of DynaKV naturally extend to other long-context workloads and multi-tier memory hierarchies, underscoring its broader applicability."}

In BDD-based reversible-circuit synthesis, which is critical for quantum computing, the chosen variable ordering governs the number of BDD nodes and thus the key metrics of resource consumption, such as Quantum Cost. Because finding an optimal variable ordering for BDDs is an NP-complete problem, existing heuristics often degrade as circuit complexity grows. We introduce BDD2Seq, a graph-to-sequence framework that couples a Graph Neural Network encoder with a Pointer-Network decoder and Diverse Beam Search to predict high-quality orderings. By treating the circuit netlist as a graph, BDD2Seq learns structural dependencies that conventional heuristics overlooked, yielding smaller BDDs and faster synthesis. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks show that BDD2Seq achieves around 1.4 times lower Quantum Cost and 3.7 times faster synthesis than modern heuristic algorithms.

However, existing software architecture patterns are static, while current safety assurance methods are not scalable, leaving systems vulnerable to novel adversarial threats.\n  Objective: To design, implement, and evaluate a novel software architecture that enables an AI-driven system to autonomously and continuously adapt its own safety protocols at runtime.\n  Method: We propose the Self-Improving Safety Framework (SISF), a runtime architecture that couples an unprotected, unaligned base LLM (mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) with a dynamic feedback loop. This loop consists of an AI Adjudicator (GPT-4o) for breach detection and a Policy Synthesis Module (GPT-4 Turbo) that autonomously generates new, generalized safety policies (both heuristic and semantic) in response to failures.\n  Results: We conducted a dynamic learning evaluation using the 520-prompt AdvBench dataset. The unprotected model was 100% vulnerable. Our SISF, starting from zero policies, demonstrated a clear learning curve: it detected 237 breaches, autonomously synthesized 234 new policies, and reduced the overall Attack Success Rate (ASR) to 45.58%. In a subsequent test on 520 benign prompts, the SISF achieved a 0.00% False Positive Rate (FPR), proving its ability to adapt without compromising user utility.\n  Conclusion: An architectural approach to AI safety, based on the principles of self-adaptation, is a viable and effective strategy.

The workflows themselves, however, become increasingly complex in terms of involved components. Furthermore, they are executed on distributed cluster infrastructures, which makes the real-time collection, integration, and analysis of provenance data challenging. Existing provenance systems struggle to balance scalability, real-time processing, online provenance analytics, and integration across different components and compute resources. Moreover, most provenance solutions are not workflow-aware; by focusing on arbitrary workloads, they miss opportunities for workflow systems where optimization and analysis can exploit the availability of a workflow specification that dictates, to some degree, task execution orders and provides abstractions for physical tasks at a logical level.\n  In this paper, we present HyProv, a hybrid provenance management system that combines centralized and federated paradigms to offer scalable, online, and workflow-aware queries over workflow provenance traces. HyProv uses a centralized component for efficient management of the small and stable workflow-specification-specific provenance, and complements this with federated querying over different scalable monitoring and provenance databases for the large-scale execution logs. This enables low-latency access to current execution data. Furthermore, the design supports complex provenance queries, which we exemplify for the workflow system Airflow in combination with the resource manager Kubernetes. Our experiments indicate that HyProv scales to large workflows, answers provenance queries with sub-second latencies, and adds only modest CPU and memory overhead to the cluster."}

This paper presents Procurator, a verification framework that efficiently captures interactive behaviors in distributed in-network programs. Procurator introduces a formal model combining the actor paradigm with Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), translating pipeline execution into reactive, event-driven actors and unifying their interactions as message passing. To support flexible specification of distributed properties, it provides a unified intent language. Additionally, it incorporates a semantic-aware state pruner to reduce verification complexity, thus ensuring system scalability. Evaluation results show that Procurator efficiently uncovers 10 distinct bugs caused by interactive behaviors across five real-world in-network systems.

Benchmarking LLMs on Functional Accuracy and Energy Efficiency", "comment": null, "summary": "The rapid advancement of AI technologies and their accelerated adoption in software development necessitates a systematic evaluation of their environmental impact alongside functional correctness. While prior studies have examined sustainability in large language models, existing approaches lack systematic frameworks for evaluating accuracy-energy trade-offs in Code Language Models (CLMs). In this paper, we present a framework, BRACE, to benchmark CLMs on a unified scale of energy efficiency and functional correctness (referred to as accuracy). We benchmark 22 state-of-the-art models on code generation and summarization tasks, proposing two rating methods: Concentric Incremental Rating Circles (CIRC) and Observation to Expectation Rating (OTER). CIRC provides deterministic Euclidean-based rankings with static trade-offs that are robust to outliers, and OTER offers trend-aware evaluation with dynamic trade-offs that capture the complex correlation between energy and accuracy, each offering a distinct perspective and addressing the problem in a unique way. These rating methods enable us to rate LLMs on a 1-5 scale reflecting their combined capabilities in terms of energy efficiency and functional correctness. Our analysis reveals models generally perform better in the code summarization tasks as they are not enforced to generate a grammar-based and syntactically correct output. Also, we find that models' size does not have a significant impact on their ratings, indicating that if models utilize their parameters efficiently, they can be ranked higher on these scales. The proposed BRACE framework empowers practitioners to make evidence-based model selections that balance sustainability with task requirements, guiding rating choice -- CIRC for deterministic comparisons or OTER for trend-aware evaluation -- based on deployment priorities."}

Global temperatures have risen by approximately $0.6^\\circ$C since 1950, extending the window of transmission for mosquito-borne infections and worsening outcomes in diabetes due to metabolic stress caused by heat. People living with diabetes have already weakened immune defenses and, therefore, are at an alarmingly increased risk of contraction of malaria. However, most models rarely include both ways of interaction in changing climate conditions. In the paper, we introduce a new compartmental epidemiological model based on synthetic data fitted to disease patterns of India from 2019 to 2021. The framework captures temperature-dependent transmission parameters, seasonal variability, and different disease dynamics between diabetic and non-diabetic groups within the three-compartment system. Model calibration using Multi-Start optimization combined with Sequential Quadratic Programming allows us to find outstanding differences between populations. The odds of malaria infection in diabetic individuals were found to be 1.8--4.0 times higher, with peak infection levels in 35--36\\%, as compared to 20--21\\% in the non-diabetic ones. The fitted model was able to capture well the epidemiological patterns observed, while the basic reproduction number averaged around 2.3, ranging from 0.31 to 2.75 in different seasons. Given that India's diabetic population is set to rise to about 157 million people by 2050, these findings point to a pressing need for concerted efforts toward climate-informed health strategies and monitoring systems that address both malaria and diabetes jointly."}

Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness for systematic intelligence-per-watt benchmarking."}

SRE leverages tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system metrics, defining critical Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for maintaining high service standards. However, a significant challenge arises as many developers often lack in-depth understanding of these tools and the intricacies involved in defining appropriate SLIs and SLOs. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel SRE platform, called SRE-Llama, enhanced by Generative-AI, Federated Learning, Blockchain, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This platform aims to automate and simplify the process of monitoring, SLI/SLO generation, and alert management, offering ease in accessibility and efficy for developers. The system operates by capturing metrics from cloud-native services and storing them in a time-series database, like Prometheus and Mimir. Utilizing this stored data, our platform employs Federated Learning models to identify the most relevant and impactful SLI metrics for different services and SLOs, addressing concerns around data privacy. Subsequently, fine-tuned Meta's Llama-3 LLM is adopted to intelligently generate SLIs, SLOs, error budgets, and associated alerting mechanisms based on these identified SLI metrics. A unique aspect of our platform is the encoding of generated SLIs and SLOs as NFT objects, which are then stored on a Blockchain. This feature provides immutable record-keeping and facilitates easy verification and auditing of the SRE metrics and objectives.

In the current era, Transformer-based architectures underpin the majority of state-of-the-art (SOTA) larger models that are also increasingly deployed on customised computing hardware for low-power and real-time applications. However, the fundamentally different parallel computation paradigms between general-purpose and customised computing often lead to compromises in model transfer and deployability, which typically come at the cost of complexity, efficiency or accuracy. Moreover, many cross-platform optimisation principles have also remained underexplored in existing studies. This paper introduces UniFormer, a unified and efficient Transformer architecture for both general-purpose and customised computing platforms. By enabling higher parallelism and compute-storage fusion, UniFormer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and latency on GPUs while exhibiting strong adaptability on FPGAs. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first efficient Transformer work that jointly considers both general-purpose and customised computing architectures."}

A multimodal analysis of these projects led us to a novel visualization technique, providing a robust way to display both current and evolving software metrics over time, replacing multiple traditional visualizations with one.

In this paper, we propose the first resilience mechanism leveraging the adaptive placement of RAN functions to mitigate disruptions and recover service continuity in the presence of compromised infrastructure. Our model detects disrupted RUs due to cascading failures, reacts by re-instantiating CU and DU in alternative cloud locations, and recovers service continuity by reestablishing functional chains. We formulate this recovery process as an optimization problem that maximizes post-failure network performance while considering computational and communication constraints of the infrastructure. We numerically evaluated our approach on a real-world mobile network topology under multiple failure scenarios, and demonstrated that our solution recovers up to 70% higher throughput compared to conventional resilience mechanisms."}

It involves intentionally injecting faults into a system to test its resilience, uncover weaknesses, and address them before they cause failures in production. Recent CE tools automate the execution of predefined CE experiments. However, planning such experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. These processes are labor-intensive and require multi-domain expertise. To address these challenges and enable anyone to build resilient systems at low cost, this paper proposes ChaosEater, a system that automates the entire CE cycle with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines an agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided processes within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for software systems built on Kubernetes. Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater complete CE cycles through software engineering tasks, including requirement definition, code generation, testing, and debugging. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on small- and large-scale Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it consistently completes reasonable CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs. Its cycles are also qualitatively validated by human engineers and LLMs."}

Ensuring the quality of such systems is critical, as incorrect answers could lead to significant harm. Current state-of-the-art testing approaches apply metamorphic relations to existing test datasets, generating test questions based on these relations. However, these methods have two key limitations. First, they often produce unnatural questions that humans are unlikely to ask, reducing the effectiveness of the generated questions in identifying bugs that might occur in real-world scenarios. Second, these questions are generated from pre-existing test datasets, ignoring the broader context and thus limiting the diversity and relevance of the generated questions.\n  In this work, we introduce CQ^2A, a context-driven question generation approach for testing question-answering systems. Specifically, CQ^2A extracts entities and relationships from the context to form ground truth answers, and utilizes large language models to generate questions based on these ground truth answers and the surrounding context. We also propose the consistency verification and constraint checking to increase the reliability of LLM's outputs. Experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that CQ^2A outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the bug detection capability, the naturalness of the generated questions as well as the coverage of the context. Moreover, the test cases generated by CQ^2A reduce error rate when utilized for fine-tuning the QA software under test"}

It asks for a distributed algorithm that brings the robots to a common location, not known in advance. We consider the case of robots constrained to move along the edges of a graph under the well-known OBLOT model. Gathering is then accomplished once all the robots occupy a same vertex. Differently from classical settings, we assume: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect multiplicities; iii) robots move along the edges of vertex- and edge-transitive graphs, i.e. graphs where all the vertices (and the edges, resp.) belong to a same class of equivalence. To balance somehow such a `hostile' setting, as a scheduler for the activation of the robots, we consider the round-robin, where robots are cyclically activated one at a time.\n  We provide some basic impossibility results and we design two different algorithms approaching the Gathering for robots moving on two specific topologies belonging to edge- and vertex-transitive graphs: infinite grids and hypercubes. The two algorithms are both time-optimal and heavily exploit the properties of the underlying topologies. Because of this, we conjecture that no general algorithm can exist for all the solvable cases."}

However, past research showed that they often lack legal expertise and struggle with privacy-compliant development. To shed light on how effective current information sources are in supporting them with privacy-sensitive implementation, we conducted a qualitative study with 30 developers. Participants were presented with a privacy-sensitive scenario and asked to identify privacy issues and suggest measures using their knowledge, online resources, and an AI assistant. We observed developers' decision-making in think-aloud sessions and discussed it in follow-up interviews. We found that participants struggled with all three sources: personal knowledge was insufficient, web content was often too complex, and while AI assistants provided clear and user-tailored responses, they lacked contextual relevance and failed to identify scenario-specific issues. Our study highlights major shortcomings in existing support for privacy-related development tasks.

The scheduler, at the heart of Kubernetes' architecture, determines the placement of pods given their priority and resource requirements on cluster nodes. To quickly allocate pods, the scheduler uses lightweight heuristics that can lead to suboptimal placements and resource fragmentation, preventing allocations of otherwise deployable pods on the available nodes.\n  We propose the usage of constraint programming to find the optimal allocation of pods satisfying all their priorities and resource requests. Implementation-wise, our solution comes as a plug-in to the default scheduler that operates as a fallback mechanism when some pods cannot be allocated. Using the OR-Tools constraint solver, our experiments on small-to-mid-sized clusters indicate that, within a 1-second scheduling window, our approach places more higher-priority pods than the default scheduler (possibly demonstrating allocation optimality) in over 44\\% of realisable allocation scenarios where the default scheduler fails, while certifying that the default scheduler's placement is already optimal in over 19\\% of scenarios. With a 10-second window, our approach improves placements in over 73\\% and still certifies that the default scheduler's placement is already optimal in over 19\\% of scenarios."}

The recent explosive development of LLM extends the family of SCMs,bringing LLMs for code that revolutionize development workflows. Investigating different kinds of SCM vulnerability is the cornerstone for the security and trustworthiness of AI-powered software ecosystems, however, the fundamental one, transferable vulnerability, remains critically underexplored. Existing studies neither offer practical ways, i.e. require access to the downstream classifier of SCMs, to produce effective adversarial samples for adversarial defense, nor give heed to the widely used LLM4Code in modern software development platforms and cloud-based integrated development environments. Therefore, this work systematically studies the intrinsic vulnerability transferability of both traditional SCMs and LLM4Code, and proposes a victim-agnostic approach to generate practical adversarial samples. We design HABITAT, consisting of a tailored perturbation-inserting mechanism and a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework that adaptively selects optimal perturbations without requiring any access to the downstream classifier of SCMs. Furthermore, an intrinsic transferability analysis of SCM vulnerabilities is conducted, revealing the potential vulnerability correlation between traditional SCMs and LLM4Code, together with fundamental factors that govern the success rate of victim-agnostic transfer attacks. These findings of SCM vulnerabilities underscore the critical focal points for developing robust defenses in the future. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our constructed adversarial examples crafted based on traditional SCMs achieve up to 64% success rates against LLM4Code, surpassing the state-of-the-art by over 15%."}

Tools like KLEE are commonly used because they can automatically detect bugs and create test cases. But one of KLEE's biggest issues is how slow it can get when programs have lots of branching paths-it often becomes too resource-heavy to run on large or complex code. In this project, we wanted to see if a large language model like GPT-4o could simulate the kinds of outputs that KLEE generates. The idea was to explore whether LLMs could one day replace parts of symbolic execution to save time and resources.\n  One specific goal was to have GPT-4o identify the most constrained path in a program, this is the execution path with the most symbolic conditions. These paths are especially important because they often represent edge cases that are harder to test and more likely to contain deep bugs. However, figuring this out usually requires fully running KLEE, which can be expensive. So, we tested whether GPT-4o could predict the KLEE outputs and the most complex path using a dataset of 100 C programs. Our results showed about 20% accuracy in generating KLEE-like outputs and identifying the most constrained path. While not highly accurate, this early work helps show what current LLMs can and can't do when it comes to simulating symbolic execution."}
