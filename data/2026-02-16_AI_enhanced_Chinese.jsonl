At the same time, generative artificial intelligence is reshaping development practice, offering powerful forms of assistance while introducing new challenges for accountability, reflection, and methodological rigour. Although Action Design Research (ADR) provides a well-established foundation for studying and constructing socio-technical artefacts, it offers limited guidance on how its principles can be operationalised in the day-to-day practice of solo, AI-assisted research software development. This paper proposes the SHAPR framework (Solo, Human-centred, AI-assisted PRactice) as a practice-level operational framework that complements ADR by translating its high-level principles into actionable guidance for contemporary research contexts. SHAPR supports the enactment of ADR Building-Intervention-Evaluation cycles by making explicit the roles, artefacts, reflective practices, and lightweight governance mechanisms required to sustain human accountability and learning in AI-assisted development. The contribution of the paper is conceptual: SHAPR itself is treated as the primary design artefact and unit of analysis and is evaluated formatively through reflective analysis of its internal coherence, alignment with ADR principles, and applicability to solo research practice. By explicitly linking research software development, Human-AI collaboration, and reflective learning, this study contributes to broader discussions on how SHAPR can support both knowledge production and HDR researcher training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSHAPR\u6846\u67b6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u5458\u5728AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u95ee\u8d23\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5355\u4ebaAI\u8f85\u52a9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00bull\u53d1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65e5\u5e38\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u751f\u6210AI\u6280\u672f\u5e26\u6765\u95ee\u8d23\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u63d0\u51faSHAPR\u6846\u67b6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u00e8ve\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50ADR\u539f\u5219\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679cSHAPR\u9610\u660e\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u5de5\u4ef6\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6784\u5efa-\u5e72\u9884-\u8bc4\u4f30\u5faa\u73af\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u786e\u4fddAI\u8f85\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u95ee\u8d23\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bbaSHAPR\u6846\u67b6\u8054\u7cfb\u7814\u7a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u4eba-AI\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5b66\u4f4d\u7814\u7a76\u5458\u57f9\u8bad\u7684 broader\u8ba8\u8bba\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

We %develop measurements to gather the first direct, non-inferential, and comprehensive data on the NTP pool, including: longitudinal server and account membership, server configurations, time quality, aliases, and global query traffic load.\n  We gather complete and granular data over a nine month period to discover over 15k servers (both active and inactive) and shed new light into the NTP Pool's use, dynamics, and robustness. By analyzing address aliases, accounts, and network connectivity, we find that only 19.7% of the pool's active servers are fully independent. Finally, we show that an adversary informed with our data can better and more precisely mount \"monopoly attacks\" to capture the preponderance of NTP pool traffic in 90% of all countries with only 10 or fewer malicious NTP servers.

This report documents the outcomes of a study to characterize web tracking occurring on Army CONUS unclassified networks. We derived a dataset from the Cloud-Based Internet Isolation (CBII) platform, encompassing data measured over a two-month period in 2024. This dataset comprised the 1,000 most frequently accessed Internet resources, determined by the number of connection requests on CONUS DoDIN-A during the study period. We then compared all domains and subdomains in the dataset against Ghostery's WhoTracks.me, an open-source database of commercial tracking entities. We found that over 21% of the domains accessed during the study period were Internet trackers. The ACI recommends that the Army implement changes to its enterprise networks to limit commercial Internet-based tracking, as well as policy changes towards the same end. With relatively minor configuration changes, CBII can serve as a more effective mitigation against risks posed by commercially available information.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge this gap, we study Risk-averse Quantal response Equilibria (RQE), a solution concept rooted in behavioral game theory that incorporates risk aversion and bounded rationality. We demonstrate that RQE possesses strong regularity conditions that make it uniquely amenable to learning in MGs. We propose a novel two-timescale Actor-Critic algorithm characterized by a fast-timescale actor and a slow-timescale critic. Leveraging the regularity of RQE, we prove that this approach achieves global convergence with finite-sample guarantees.

Two methods of fixed-point data quantization, quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ), are utilized in Brevitas. With Tensil, which is used in the current design flow, the bit widths of the integer and fractional parts need to be 8 bits each or 16 bits each when implemented in hardware, but performance validation has shown that accuracy comparable to floating-point operations can be maintained even with 6 bits or 5 bits each, indicating potential for further reduction in computational resources.

While functionality-oriented GUI testing has attracted growing research attention, existing approaches largely overlook interactions across functionalities, making them ineffective at uncovering deep bugs hidden in inter-functional behaviors. To fill this gap, we first design a Functional Flow Graph (FFG), a behavioral model that explicitly captures an app's functional units and their inter-functional interactions. Based on the FFG, we further introduce an inter-functional-flow-oriented GUI testing approach with the dual goals of precise model construction and deep bug detection. This approach is realized through a long-short-term-view-guided testing process. By combining two complementary test-generation views, it can adaptively refine functional boundaries and systematically explore inter-functional flows under diverse triggering conditions.

Rather than encoding all procedural knowledge within model weights, agent skills -- composable packages of instructions, code, and resources that agents load on demand -- enable dynamic capability extension without retraining. It is formalized in a paradigm of progressive disclosure, portable skill definitions, and integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This survey provides a comprehensive treatment of the agent skills landscape, as it has rapidly evolved during the last few months. We organize the field along four axes: (i) architectural foundations, examining the SKILL.md specification, progressive context loading, and the complementary roles of skills and MCP; (ii) skill acquisition, covering reinforcement learning with skill libraries (SAGE), autonomous skill discovery (SEAgent), and compositional skill synthesis; (iii) deployment at scale, including the computer-use agent (CUA) stack, GUI grounding advances, and benchmark progress on OSWorld and SWE-bench; and (iv) security, where recent empirical analyses reveal that 26.1\\% of community-contributed skills contain vulnerabilities, motivating our proposed Skill Trust and Lifecycle Governance Framework -- a four-tier, gate-based permission model that maps skill provenance to graduated deployment capabilities. We identify seven open challenges -- from cross-platform skill portability to capability-based permission models -- and propose a research agenda for realizing trustworthy, self-improving skill ecosystems. Unlike prior surveys that broadly cover LLM agents or tool use, this work focuses specifically on the emerging skill abstraction layer and its implications for the next generation of agentic systems.

Cache data analysis requires parsing millions of trace entries with manual filtering, making the process slow and non-interactive. To address this, we introduce CacheMind, a conversational tool that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable semantic reasoning over cache traces. Architects can now ask natural language questions like, \"Why is the memory access associated with PC X causing more evictions?\", and receive trace-grounded, human-readable answers linked to program semantics for the first time. To evaluate CacheMind, we present CacheMindBench, the first verified benchmark suite for LLM-based reasoning for the cache replacement problem. Using the SIEVE retriever, CacheMind achieves 66.67% on 75 unseen trace-grounded questions and 84.80% on 25 unseen policy-specific reasoning tasks; with RANGER, it achieves 89.33% and 64.80% on the same evaluations. Additionally, with RANGER, CacheMind achieves 100% accuracy on 4 out of 6 categories in the trace-grounded tier of CacheMindBench. Compared to LlamaIndex (10% retrieval success), SIEVE achieves 60% and RANGER achieves 90%, demonstrating that existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) are insufficient for precise, trace-grounded microarchitectural reasoning. We provided four concrete actionable insights derived using CacheMind, wherein bypassing use case improved cache hit rate by 7.66% and speedup by 2.04%, software fix use case gives speedup of 76%, and Mockingjay replacement policy use case gives speedup of 0.7%; showing the utility of CacheMind on non-trivial queries that require a natural-language interface.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdCacheMind\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301roud\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2CPU\u7f13\u5b58\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636esemantic\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u8fdb\u7f13\u5b58\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7CacheMindBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f13\u5b58\u66ff\u6362\u95ee\u9898\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u542f\u53d1\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f13\u6162\u4e14\u975e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7f13\u5b58\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CacheMind\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 \uc804\ubb38 RAG\u548cLL executor\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u95ee\u8fdb\u884c\u7f13\u5b58\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f7f\u7528CacheMindBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4SIEVE\u548cRANGER\u7b49\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf975\u4e2a\u672a\u89c1\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0cCacheMind\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe66.67%\uff08SIEVE\uff09\u621689.33%\uff08RANGER\uff09\uff1b\u5bf925\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fbe84.80%\uff08SIEVE\uff09\u621664.80%\uff08RANGER\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982bypassing\u7528\u4f8b\u63d0\u5347\u547d\u4e2d\u73877.66%\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe76%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Trading off performance and sustainability SLOs is especially challenging.

Prior work in zero-shot coordination often follows a two-stage process, first generating a diverse training pool of partner agents, and then training a best-response agent to collaborate effectively with the entire training pool. While many previous works have achieved strong performance by devising better ways to diversify the partner agent pool, there has been less emphasis on how to leverage this pool to build an adaptive agent. One limitation is that the best-response agent may converge to a static, generalist policy that performs reasonably well across diverse teammates, rather than learning a more adaptive, specialist policy that can better adapt to teammates and achieve higher synergy. To address this, we propose an adaptive ensemble agent that uses Theory-of-Mind-based best-response selection to first infer its teammate's intentions and then select the most suitable policy from a policy ensemble.

To address this, we present MXFormer, a novel, hybrid, weight-stationary Compute-in-Memory (CIM) accelerator that provides high throughput and efficiency for fixed-model inference on large short-sequence Transformers. Our architecture's foundation is the use of ultra-dense Charge-Trap Transistors (CTTs) in Microscaling MXFP4 CIM arrays, uniquely enabling the on-chip storage of up to hundreds of millions of parameters in Fully Weight Stationary (FWS) fashion.\n  We introduce a statically partitioned design with 12 Transformer blocks connected by a deeply pipelined dataflow. Static-weight layers (MLPs and linear projections) execute on highly parallel analog CTT arrays using an MXFP4-native flow with per-block exponent alignment and a 10-bit SAR ADC.

These systems rely heavily on distributed architectures, requiring robust mechanisms to manage data and interactions among participants securely. One critical aspect of decentralized systems is key management, which is essential for encrypting files, securing database segments, and enabling private transactions. However, securely managing cryptographic keys in a distributed environment poses significant risks, especially when nodes in the network can be compromised [9]. This research proposes a decentralized database scheme specifically designed for secure and private key management. Our approach ensures that cryptographic keys are not stored explicitly at any location, preventing their discovery even if an attacker gains control of multiple nodes. Instead of traditional storage, keys are encoded and distributed using the BFLUT (Bloom Filter for Private Look-Up Tables) algorithm [7], which enables secure retrieval without direct exposure. The system leverages OrbitDB [4], IPFS [1], and IPNS [10] for decentralized data management, providing robust support for consistency, scalability, and simultaneous updates. By combining these technologies, our scheme enhances both security and privacy while maintaining high performance and reliability. Our findings demonstrate the system's capability to securely manage keys, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure privacy, making it a foundational solution for Web3 applications requiring decentralized security.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e BFLUT \u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u79c1\u6709\u5bc6\u94a5\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 OrbitDB\u3001IPFS \u548c IPNS \u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3 Web3 \u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bc6\u94a5\u7ba1\u7406\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5bc6\u94a5\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 BFLUT \u7b97\u6cd5\u7f16\u7801\u5e76\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u5bc6\u94a5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f4\u63a5\u66b4\u9732\uff1b\u96c6\u6210 OrbitDB\u3001IPFS \u548c IPNS \u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u652f\u6301\u3002", "DGError": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u4fdd\u969c\u5bc6\u94a5\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u963b\u6b62\u672a\u6388\u6743\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u7684 Web3 \u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "Result analysis unavailable"}}

Although code smells are widely believed to harm maintainability, most prior stability studies examine only the smells within the class being modified. In practice, however, classes can change because their efferent neighbors (i.e., the classes they depend on) are modified due to ripple effects that propagate along static dependencies, even if the class itself is clean. Such ripple effects may be more severe when the efferent neighbor exhibits code smells. In addition, code smells rarely occur alone. They often appear together within a class or across classes connected by static dependencies, a phenomenon known as code smell interrelation. Such interrelation can lead to code smell interaction, where smells are directly connected through static dependencies and may further compound maintainability issues. However, the effect of code smell interrelation and interaction on code quality remains largely underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates whether the presence of code smells in a class's efferent neighbors affects its stability, considering the factor of code smell interrelation and interaction. To achieve this, we mine one year of commit history from 100 top-starred GitHub projects, detect code smells and static dependencies, determine code smell interrelation and interaction, and model these factors as predictors of class stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790100\u4e2aGitHub\u9ad8\u661f\u9879\u76ee\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8c03\u67e5efferent\u90bb\u5c45\uff08\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c7b\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7c7b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u7c7b\u5185\u90e8\u5f02\u5473\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u56e0efferent\u90bb\u5c45\u4fee\u6539\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u8fde\u9501\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5f02\u5473\u4e92\u5173\u4e0e\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u98ce\u9669\u52a0\u5267\u3002", "method": "\u6316\u6398\u4e00\u5e74\u63d0\u4ea4\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u548c\u9759\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5f02\u5473\u4e92\u5173\uff08smell interrelation\uff09\u548c\u4e92\u52a8\uff08smell interaction\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06cial\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7c7b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u672a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u5f02\u5473\u4e92\u5173\u4e0e\u4e92\u52a8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u4e92\u5173\u548c\u4e92\u52a8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In this paper, we conduct a confirmatory study to investigate such limitations by evaluating the effectiveness of state-of-the-art chatbot testing techniques on a curated selection of task-based chatbots from GitHub, developed using the most popular commercial and open-source platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e1a\u754c\u9886\u5148\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u578b\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GitHub\u7cbe\u9009\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u73b0\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u9a8c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u65b0\u5174\u6280\u672f\u867d\u8fdb\u6b65\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u7b80\u5355\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u8584\u5f31\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u9009GitHub\u4e0a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u5f00\u6e90\u5e73\u53f0\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u578b\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u5728\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u5177\u4f53\u8bf4\u660e", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u4efb\u52a1\u578b\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for collaborative intrusion detection; however, device and data heterogeneity introduce major challenges, including straggler delays, unstable convergence, and unbalanced error rates. This paper presents a Calibrated Federated Learning method with Hardware-aware Fuzzy Clustering (CF-HFC) to enhance intrusion detection performance in heterogeneous IoT networks. The proposed three-tier Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture integrates three complementary components: (1) hardware-aware fuzzy clustering, which organizes clients by computational capacity to mitigate straggler effects; (2) Fuzzy-FedProx aggregation, which stabilizes optimization under non-IID data distributions; and (3) Adaptive Conformal Calibration (ACC), which dynamically adjusts decision thresholds to balance false negative and false positive rates. Extensive experiments on ToN-IoT, BoT-IoT, Edge-IIoTset, and CICDDoS2019 datasets demonstrate that CF-HFC outperforms baseline methods such as FedAvg and FedProx, achieving over 99% detection accuracy, faster convergence, and lower communication latency.

Meanwhile, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have become dominant, with rapidly increasing model sizes but low degree of parameter reuse compared to conventional CNNs, making end-to-end execution on resource-limited devices extremely challenging. To address these challenges, we propose TriGen, a novel NPU architecture tailored for resource-constrained environments through software-hardware co-design. Firstly, TriGen adopts low-precision computation using microscaling (MX) to enable additional optimization opportunities while preserving accuracy, and resolves the issues that arise by employing such precision. Secondly, to jointly optimize both nonlinear and linear operations, TriGen eliminates the need for specialized hardware for essential nonlinear operations by using fast and accurate LUT, thereby maximizing performance gains and reducing hardware-cost in on-device environments, and finally, by taking practical hardware constraints into account, further employs scheduling techniques to maximize computational utilization even under limited on-chip memory capacity. We evaluate the performance of TriGen on various LLMs and show that TriGen achieves an average 2.73x performance speedup and 52% less memory transfer over the baseline NPU design with negligible accuracy loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The three most prevalent patterns are Pinned Version Bump (26%), revealing brittle release practices; Long Line Change (17%), signalling deficient layout; and Formatting Ping-Pong (9%), indicating missing or inconsistent style automation. Surprisingly, automated accounts generate 74% of all hotspot edits, suggesting that bot activity is a dominant but largely avoidable source of noise in change histories.

This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, akin to chatting with a real person. However, a fundamental mismatch exists between current RTC frameworks and AI Video Assistants, stemming from the drastic shift in Quality of Experience (QoE) and more challenging networks. Measurements on our production prototype also confirm that current RTC fails, causing latency spikes and accuracy drops.\n  To address these challenges, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented RTC framework for MLLM Video Assistants, exploring the shift from \"humans watching video\" to \"AI understanding video.\" Specifically, Artic proposes: (1) Response Capability-aware Adaptive Bitrate, which utilizes MLLM accuracy saturation to proactively cap bitrate, reserving bandwidth headroom to absorb future fluctuations for latency reduction; (2) Zero-overhead Context-aware Streaming, which allocates limited bitrate to regions most important for the response, maintaining accuracy even under ultra-low bitrates; and (3) Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark, the first benchmark evaluating how RTC-induced video degradation affects MLLM accuracy. Prototype experiments using real-world uplink traces show that compared with existing methods, Artic significantly improves accuracy by 15.12% and reduces latency by 135.31 ms.

However, since QUIC provides end-to-end encryption for both data and packet headers, in-network assistance like Performance-Enhancing Proxy (PEP) is unavailable for QUIC. To achieve the similar optimization as TCP, some works seek to collaborate endpoints and middleboxes to provide in-network assistance for QUIC. But involving both host and in-network devices increases the difficulty of deployment in the Internet.\n  In this paper, by analyzing the QUIC standard, implementations, and the locality of application traffic, we identify opportunities for transparent middleboxes to measure RTT and infer packet loss for QUIC connections, despite the absence of plaintext ACK information. We then propose PEMI as a concrete system that continuously measures RTT and infers lost packets, enabling fast retransmissions for QUIC. PEMI enables performance enhancement for QUIC in a completely transparent manner, without requiring any explicit cooperation from the endpoints. To keep fairness, PEMI employs a delay-based congestion control and utilizes feedback-based methods to enforce CWND. Extensive evaluation results, including Mininet and trace-driven dynamic experiments, show that PEMI can significantly improve the performance of QUIC. For example, in the Mininet experiments, PEMI increases the goodput of file transfers by up to 2.5$\\times$, and reduces the 90th percentile jitter of RTC frames by 20-75%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
