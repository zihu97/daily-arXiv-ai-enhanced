We present Hive hash table, a\nhigh-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table\nthat adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.\n  Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed\nbucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory\naccess and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous\nconcurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and\nWarp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic\noperation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a\nload-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in\nwarp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced\noccupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs\na four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and\noverflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded\nrecovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while\neliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.\n  Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains\nload factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than\nstate-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed\ninsert-delete-lookup workloads.

Evaluating 16 LLMs\n(including three reasoning LLMs) using CES indicates 81.42% coherent execution\nsimulation on HumanEval, 46.92% and 53.08% of which result in correct and\nincorrect output predictions.

However, reviewers often work\nunder time pressure and rely primarily on static inspection, leaving the\ndynamic aspects of the program unexplored. Dynamic analyses could reveal such\nbehaviors, but they are rarely integrated into reviews. Among them, fuzzing is\ntypically applied later to uncover crashing bugs. Yet its ability to exercise\ncode with diverse inputs makes it promising for exposing non-crashing, but\nunexpected, behaviors earlier. Still, without suitable mechanisms to analyze\nprogram behaviors, the rich data produced during fuzzing remains inaccessible\nto reviewers, limiting its practical value in this context.\n  We hypothesize that unexpected variations in program behaviors could signify\npotential bugs.

Representing program behavior as likely invariants, dynamic properties\nconsistently observed at specific program points, can provide practical signals\nof behavioral changes. Such signals offer a way to distinguish between intended\nchanges and unexpected behavioral shifts from code changes.\n  We present FuzzSight, a framework that leverages likely invariants from\nnon-crashing fuzzing inputs to highlight behavioral differences across program\nversions.
