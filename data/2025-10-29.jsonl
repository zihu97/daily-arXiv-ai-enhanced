Detecting\nsuch failures on-chip is challenging, as prior methods from distributed systems\nare unsuitable due to strict memory limits and their inability to track\nfailures across the hardware topology. This paper introduces SlowPoke, a\nlightweight, hardware-aware framework for practical on-chip fail-slow\ndetection. SlowPoke combines compiler-based instrumentation for low-overhead\nmonitoring, on-the-fly trace compression to operate within kilobytes of memory,\nand a novel topology-aware ranking algorithm to pinpoint a failure's root\ncause. We evaluate SlowPoke on a wide range of representative many-core\nworkloads, and the results demonstrate that SlowPoke reduces the storage\noverhead of detection traces by an average of 115.9$\\times$, while achieving an\naverage fail-slow detection accuracy of 86.77% and a false positive rate (FPR)\nof 12.11%.

We model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision\nProcess (POMDP), where two heterogeneous UAV agents, a high-level rescuer (HLR)\nand a low-level rescuer (LLR), coordinate through shared observations and\ncomplementary capabilities.

Given a set of tests, TDFlow repeatedly\nproposes, revises, and debugs repository-scale patches using precisely\nengineered sub-agents and tightly constrained tools. The workflow decomposes\nsoftware engineering program repair into four components governed by respective\nsub-agents. This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch\nrevision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any\nindividual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined\nsub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific\nsub-tasks. When provided human-written tests, TDFlow attains 88.8% pass rate on\nSWE-Bench Lite (an absolute improvement of 27.8% over the next best system) and\n94.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Manual inspection of the 800 TDFlow runs within\nSWE-Bench Lite and Verified uncover only 7 instances of test hacking, which\nwere subsequently counted as failures. Furthermore, we show that the primary\nobstacle to human-level software engineering performance lies within writing\nsuccessful reproduction tests. We envision a human-LLM interactive system\npowered by TDFlow where human developers write tests solved by LLM systems.\nTogether, these results indicate that modern LLMs, when embedded in a narrowly\nengineered, test-driven workflow, already achieve human-level test resolution\n-- with the final frontier for fully autonomous repository repair being the\naccurate generation of valid reproduction tests."}

We present ARIMA_PLUS, a novel framework to overcome these\ntwo challenges by a unique combination of (a) accurate and interpretable time\nseries models and (b) scalable and fully managed system infrastructure. The\nmodel has a sequential and modular structure to handle different components of\nthe time series, including holiday effects, seasonality, trend, and anomalies,\nwhich enables high interpretability of the results. Novel enhancements are made\nto each module, and a unified framework is established to address both\nforecasting and anomaly detection tasks simultaneously.

Besides its technical aspect, interoperability has also an\neconomic side, as development time efforts are required to build the\ninteroperability artifacts. Objectives: With the recent advances in the field\nof large language models (LLMs), we aim at analyzing the effectiveness of\nLLM-based strategies to make systems interoperate autonomously, at runtime,\nwithout human intervention. Method: We selected 13 open source LLMs and curated\nfour versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case. We\nperformed three runs of each model with each version of the dataset, using two\ndifferent strategies. Then we compared the effectiveness of the models and the\nconsistency of their results across multiple runs. Results: qwen2.5-coder:32b\nwas the most effective model using both strategies DIRECT (average pass@1 >=\n0.99) and CODEGEN (average pass@1 >= 0.89) in three out of four dataset\nversions. In the fourth dataset version, which included an unit conversion, all\nmodels using the strategy DIRECT failed, whereas using CODEGEN\nqwen2.5-coder:32b succeeded with an average pass@1 = 0.75. Conclusion: Some\nLLMs can make systems interoperate autonomously. Further evaluation in\ndifferent domains is recommended, and further research on reliability\nstrategies should be conducted."}

Alerts help teams catch faults early before they turn into\nproduction outages and serve as first clues for troubleshooting. However,\ndesigning effective alerts is challenging. They need to strike a fine balance\nbetween catching issues early and minimizing false alarms. On top of this,\nalerts often cover uncommon faults, so the code is rarely executed and\ntherefore rarely checked. To address these challenges, several industry\npractitioners advocate for testing alerting code with the same rigor as\napplication code. Still, there's a lack of tools that support such systematic\ndesign and validation of alerts.\n  This paper introduces a new alerting extension for the observability\nexperimentation tool OXN. It lets engineers experiment with alerts early during\ndevelopment. With OXN, engineers can now tune rules at design time and\nroutinely validate the firing behavior of their alerts, avoiding future\nproblems at runtime."}
