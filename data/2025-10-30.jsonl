Through a series of\ncontrolled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test\nwhether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of\nsubjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and\nbehavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families.

Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to\nsystematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing\ncurrent techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,\nfocusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient\nTraining, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)\nEfficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and\nutilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods\nwithin this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational\nreference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,\ndelineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We\nmaintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:\nhttps://evla-survey.github.io/"}

However,\nthe complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by\nlarge scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or\nrelational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing\nautomatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,\noften suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor\nadaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA\n(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that\nautonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex\nindustrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided\nself-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea\nAgents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,\nand implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and\nupdates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable\ncontinual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution\nalgorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to\nbalance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive\nexperiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate\nexplainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model\nperformance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential\nof LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,\ninterpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world\nenvironments."}

To solve this problem, we\nintroduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that\ndelivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low\nlatency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.\nFirst, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by\ncomputing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a\nsingle pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient\nRepresentation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)\nfrom the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window\nAttention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local\ninformation, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves\nthe high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra\nlatency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer."}

The results show a weak\npositive correlation between translation performance and grammatical\nunderstanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply\ndeep grammatical competence.

Recently, implicit CoT approaches have\nemerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed\n``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates\nCoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.\nHowever, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)\nthey fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning\n(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,\nresulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on\nreducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the\nconsiderable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning\ntoken. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned\nimplicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,\nwe design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic\nalignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce\nsemantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the\nsecond challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by\nfinetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This\ngenerator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth\nreasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing\nfor accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by\njointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic\nalignment with ground-truth reasoning.

Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not\ninherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that\nMDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP\nframework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation."}

Through a series of\ncontrolled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test\nwhether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of\nsubjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and\nbehavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are\nmechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated\nwith deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features\nsharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them\nminimizes such claims.

To address this gap, we\ninvestigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing\nsix metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one\nhand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA\nzero-shot direct assessment on the other hand.

Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and\ndemonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic\nequivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias\ntoward LLM-paraphrased translations.

This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation\nof high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.\n1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve\nthe target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since\nthe model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its\nperformance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become\nbiased towards the generated data.\n  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original\nrectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into\nthe training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method\neffectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data.

Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded\nspecific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,\nwhich extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using\nthe shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared\nbackbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain\nhead-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head\ndetection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing\nthe gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense\nfeature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the\nsuboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,\nwe propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the\ngaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity\nover Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to\nvariations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze\nobject detection and gaze following tasks."}

This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process.

To further enhance\ninterpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the\nregion's most influential predictions, providing insights into its\ndecision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet\narchitecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly\ncompetitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising\ndirection for liver tumor detection in clinical practice."}

To\naddress this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first\ngenerates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then\nperforms auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and\ninformative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a\nsequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs\nconvey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture\nthe redundancy across consecutive AD outputs.

In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base\nmodels, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE\nachieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06.

Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on\noptimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision\nor on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric\napproximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D\ngeneration of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with\nthe advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending\nthese methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models\nposes significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a\ntraining-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of\ntraining a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a\npre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape\nprior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by\ntreating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images\ncaptured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the\nobject's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring\ntask-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets.
