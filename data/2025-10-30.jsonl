Traditional agent-based or deep\nlearning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to\ncapture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative\nreasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical\nLLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level\nnarrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral\nexecution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent\nis employed as a \"creative writer\" to produce diary-style narratives rich in\nmotivation and context, then uses another agent as a \"structural parser\" to\nconvert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module\nfurther grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive\nbehavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility\nEntropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility\nacross different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent\nexecutes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time\nintervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding\nthis multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic\ntrajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable\nrepresentations of human decision logic.

We introduce Seeing Eye, a\nmodular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through\nan agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception\nagent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively\ndistill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs)\ntailored to the question.

These results expose\ncritical limitations in current CC schemes and provide insight for designing\nLEO-specific data transport protocols."}

This version includes minor lstlisting configuration\n  adjustments for successful compilation.

CBD typically\nutilizes the C programming language for its direct hardware access and\nlow-level operations, despite its susceptibility to memory-related issues. To\naddress these concerns, this paper proposes TECS/Rust, a Rust-based framework\nspecifically designed for TECS, which is a component framework for embedded\nsystems. It leverages Rust's compile-time memory-safe features, such as\nlifetime and borrowing, to mitigate memory vulnerabilities common with C. The\nproposed framework not only ensures memory safety but also maintains the\nflexibility of CBD, automates Rust code generation for CBD components, and\nsupports efficient integration with real-time operating systems. An evaluation\nof the amount of generated code indicates that the code generated by this paper\nframework accounts for a large percentage of the actual code. Compared to code\ndeveloped without the proposed framework, the difference in execution time is\nminimal, indicating that the overhead introduced by the proposed framework is\nnegligible."}

However, the need for specialized expertise\nto write precise specifications, navigate complex proof obligations, and learn\nannotations often makes verification an order of magnitude more expensive than\nimplementation. While modern AI systems can recognize patterns in mathematical\nproofs and interpret natural language, effectively integrating them into the\nformal verification process remains an open challenge. We present Prometheus, a\nnovel AI-assisted system that facilitates automated code verification with\ncurrent AI capabilities in conjunction with modular software engineering\nprinciples (e.g., modular refactoring). Our approach begins by decomposing\ncomplex program logic, such as nested loops, into smaller, verifiable\ncomponents. Once verified, these components are recomposed to construct a proof\nof the original program. This decomposition-recomposition workflow is\nnon-trivial. Prometheus addresses this by guiding the proof search through\nstructured decomposition of complex lemmas into smaller, verifiable sub-lemmas.\nWhen automated tools are insufficient, users can provide lightweight natural\nlanguage guidance to steer the proof process effectively. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that transiently applying modular restructuring to the code\nsubstantially improves the AI's effectiveness in verifying individual\ncomponents. This approach successfully verifies 86% of tasks in our curated\ndataset, compared to 68% for the baseline.

One important step towards excelling in empirical research on\nLLMs and their application is to first understand to what extent current\nresearch results are eventually reproducible and what factors may impede\nreproducibility. This investigation is within the scope of our work. We\ncontribute an analysis of the reproducibility of LLM-centric studies, provide\ninsights into the factors impeding reproducibility, and discuss suggestions on\nhow to improve the current state. In particular, we studied the 86 articles\ndescribing LLM-centric studies, published at ICSE 2024 and ASE 2024. Of the 86\narticles, 18 provided research artefacts and used OpenAI models.

To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should\nmake rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default,\nwithout blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers\nface a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low\ncoding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default including\nversioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs,\nand recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models,\nmetrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing\ntools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization\nworkflows in particular. In this paper we introduce LOCALIZE, a low-code,\nconfiguration-first framework for radio localization in which experiments are\ndeclared in human-readable configuration, a workflow orchestrator runs\nstandardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts,\nsuch as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. The\npreconfigured, versioned datasets reduce initial setup and boilerplate,\nspeeding up model development and evaluation. The design, with clear extension\npoints, allows experts to add components without reworking the infrastructure.\nIn a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter\nnotebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while\nmaintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a\nBluetooth Low Energy dataset, we show that scaling across training data (1x to\n10x) keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows.

While conceptual modeling languages like\ni* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational\nmechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence.\nConversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide\nalgorithmic updating but lack grounding in requirements engineering contexts\nand conceptual models. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a\ncomputational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic\ncoopetition with dynamic trust evolution. We introduce trust as a two-layer\nsystem with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation\ntracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where\ncooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating\nhysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We\ndevelop a structured translation framework enabling requirements engineers to\ninstantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks and\norganizational contexts. Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125\nparameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias,\nhysteresis effects, and cumulative damage amplification.
