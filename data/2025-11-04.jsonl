AeroResQ adopts a multi-layer orchestration\narchitecture comprising service drones (SDs) and coordinator drones (CDs), each\nperforming specialized roles. SDs survey fire-affected areas, detect stranded\nindividuals using onboard edge accelerators running fire detection and human\npose identification DNN models, and issue requests for assistance. CDs,\nequipped with lightweight data stores such as Apache IoTDB, dynamically\ngenerate optimal ground escape routes and monitor firefighter movements along\nthese routes. The framework proposes a collaborative path-planning approach\nbased on a weighted A* search algorithm, where CDs compute context-aware escape\npaths. AeroResQ further incorporates intelligent load-balancing and resilience\nmechanisms: CD failures trigger automated data redistribution across IoTDB\nreplicas, while SD failures initiate geo-fenced re-partitioning and\nreassignment of spatial workloads to operational SDs. We evaluate AeroResQ\nusing realistic wildfire emulated setup modeled on recent Southern California\nwildfires. Experimental results demonstrate that AeroResQ achieves a nominal\nend-to-end latency of <=500ms, much below the 2s request interval, while\nmaintaining over 98% successful task reassignment and completion, underscoring\nits feasibility for real-time, on-field deployment in emergency response and\nfirefighter safety operations."}

Prior research has primarily focused on star networks featuring\nbit-flip and depolarizing channels, leaving the broader problem -- such as QNT\nfor networks with arbitrary topologies and general Pauli channels -- largely\nunexplored. Moreover, establishing channel identifiability remains a\nsignificant challenge even in simplified quantum star networks.\n  In the first part of this paper, we introduce a novel network tomography\nmethod, termed Mergecast, in quantum networks. We demonstrate that Mergecast,\ntogether with a progressive etching procedure, enables the unique\nidentification of all internal quantum channels in networks characterized by\narbitrary topologies and Pauli channels. As a side contribution, we introduce a\nsubclass of Pauli channels, termed bypassable Pauli channels, and propose a\nmore efficient unicast-based tomography method, called BypassUnicast, for\nnetworks exclusively comprising these channels. In the second part, we extend\nour investigation to a more realistic QNT scenario that incorporates state\npreparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. We rigorously formulate SPAM errors\nin QNT, propose estimation protocols for such errors within QNT, and\nsubsequently adapt our Mergecast approaches to handle networks affected by SPAM\nerrors. Lastly, we conduct NetSquid-based simulations to corroborate the\neffectiveness of our proposed protocols in identifying internal quantum\nchannels and estimating SPAM errors in quantum networks.

Evaluating\nwhether LMs can also iteratively develop code to better accomplish open-ended\nobjectives without any explicit guidance remains an open challenge. To address\nthis, we introduce CodeClash, a benchmark where LMs compete in multi-round\ntournaments to build the best codebase for achieving a competitive objective.\nEach round proceeds in two phases: agents edit their code, then their codebases\ncompete head-to-head in a code arena that determines winners based on\nobjectives like score maximization, resource acquisition, or survival.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled neural\napproaches to decompilation, but the generated code is typically only\nsemantically plausible rather than truly executable, limiting their practical\nreliability. These shortcomings arise from compiler optimizations and the loss\nof semantic cues in compiled code, which LLMs struggle to recover without\ncontextual guidance. To address this challenge, we propose ICL4Decomp, a hybrid\ndecompilation framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) to guide LLMs\ntoward generating re-executable source code. We evaluate our method across\nmultiple datasets, optimization levels, and compilers, demonstrating around\n40\\% improvement in re-executability over state-of-the-art decompilation\nmethods while maintaining robustness."}

Traditional Integrated\nDevelopment Environments (IDEs) focus primarily on code authoring, lacking\nintelligent support for the full ML lifecycle, while existing MLOps platforms\nremain detached from the coding workflow. To address this gap, this study\nproposes the design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with automated MLOps pipelines\nthat enables continuous model development and monitoring within a single\nenvironment. The proposed system embeds a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant\ncapable of code generation, debugging recommendation, and automatic pipeline\nconfiguration. The backend incorporates automated data validation, feature\nstorage, drift detection, retraining triggers, and CI/CD deployment\norchestration. This framework was implemented in a prototype named SmartMLOps\nStudio and evaluated using classification and forecasting tasks on the UCI\nAdult and M5 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartMLOps Studio\nreduces pipeline configuration time by 61%, improves experiment reproducibility\nby 45%, and increases drift detection accuracy by 14% compared to traditional\nworkflows. By bridging intelligent code assistance and automated operational\npipelines, this research establishes a novel paradigm for AI engineering -\ntransforming the IDE from a static coding tool into a dynamic, lifecycle-aware\nintelligent platform for scalable and efficient model development."}

However,\nsuch workflows are inherently error-prone: incorrect or partially correct\noutput at one step can propagate or even amplify through subsequent stages,\ncompounding the impact on the final output. Recent work proposes integrating\nverifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate,\nor LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms. Yet, verifying every step introduces significant\nlatency and cost overheads.\n  In this work, we seek to answer three key questions: which nodes in a\nworkflow are most error-prone and thus deserve costly verification, how to\nselect the most appropriate verifier for each node, and how to use verification\nwith minimal impact to latency? Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using\ncounterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and\nselectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime,\nSherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead,\nwhile verification runs in the background. If verification fails, execution is\nrolled back to the last verified output. Compared to the non-verifying\nbaseline, Sherlock delivers an 18.3% accuracy gain on average across\nbenchmarks. Sherlock reduces workflow execution time by up to 48.7% over\nnon-speculative execution and lowers verification cost by 26.0% compared to the\nMonte Carlo search-based method, demonstrating that principled, fault-aware\nverification effectively balances efficiency and reliability in agentic\nworkflows."}

Built as an\ninfrastructure layer on top of LangGraph, AgentGit supports state commit,\nrevert, and branching, allowing agents to traverse, compare, and explore\nmultiple trajectories efficiently. To evaluate AgentGit, we designed an\nexperiment that optimizes target agents by selecting better prompts.
