It is tailored for serverless scalable architectures and uses a log-based rollback recovery protocol. LOG.io supports a general programming model, accommodating non-deterministic operators, interactions with external systems, and arbitrary custom code. It is non-blocking, allowing failed operators to recover independently without interrupting other active operators, thereby leveraging data parallelization, and it facilitates dynamic scaling of operators during pipeline execution. Performance evaluations, conducted within the SAP Data Intelligence system, compare LOG.io with the Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS) protocol, originally implemented in Flink. Our experiments show that when there are straggler operators in a data pipeline and the throughput of events is moderate (e.g., 1 event every 100 ms), LOG.io performs as well as ABS during normal processing and outperforms ABS during recovery. Otherwise, ABS performs better than LOG.io for both normal processing and recovery. However, we show that in these cases, data parallelization can largely reduce the overhead of LOG.io while ABS does not improve. Finally, we show that the overhead of data lineage capture, at the granularity of the event and between any two operators in a pipeline, is marginal, with less than 1.5% in all our experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "LOG.io \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u4e0e\u975e\u963b\u585e\u56de\u6eda\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u5bb9\u9519\u6062\u590d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u56de\u6eda\u6062\u590d\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u7b97\u5b50\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea4\u4e92\u53ca\u4efb\u610f\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u7f29\u5bb9\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6162\u901f\u7b97\u5b50\u4e14\u541e\u5410\u9002\u4e2d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cLOG.io \u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e ABS\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u884c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u800c ABS \u65e0\u6cd5\u53d7\u76ca\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u6eaf\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u4e8e 1.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "LOG.io \u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u4f18\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6781\u4f4e\u6eaf\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u9700\u7075\u6d3b\u5bb9\u9519\u4e0e\u6eaf\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

Although intra-server multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory is theoretically possible, heterogeneous protocols such as PCIe and NVLink currently limit the bandwidth between host memory and GPUs to that of a single PICe link. This limitation resuals in underutilized intra-server bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a scheme that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enalbe efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory. MMA supports seamless deployment via dynamic library injection, enabling LLM applications to benefit from MMA without requiring any code modification. In our testbed, MMA significantly improves the data transfer bandwidth between the GPU and memory, achieving a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s-representing a 4.62x speedup compared to the natice single-path bandwidth. End-to-end evaluations demonstrate that MMA reduces the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for LLM serving by 1.14x to 2.38x and decreases model-switching latency in vLLM's sleep mode by 1.12x to 2.48x.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMA\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347GPU\u4e0e\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u4f18\u5316LLM\u670d\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "PCIe\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f02\u6784\u534f\u8bae\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5185\u5e26\u5bbd\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultipath Memory Access\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5e93\u6ce8\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e26\u5bbd\u5cf0\u503c\u8fbe245GB/s\uff084.62\u500d\u63d0\u5347\uff09\uff0cTTFT\u964d\u4f4e1.14x-2.38x\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5207\u6362\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c111.12x-2.48x\u3002", "conclusion": "MMA\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834PCIe\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347LLM\u670d\u52a1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Conventional underwater acoustic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems primarily utilize spatial diversity but suffer from limited array resolution, causing angular ambiguity and insufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper addresses these limitations through acoustic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (aRIS) to actively generate orthogonally distinguishable virtual paths, significantly enhancing spatial DoFs and channel capacity. An ocean-specific DoF-channel coupling model is established, explicitly deriving conditions for spatial rank enhancement. Subsequently, the optimal geometric locus, termed the Light-Point, is analytically identified, where deploying a single aRIS maximizes DoFs by introducing two and three additional resolvable paths in deep-sea and shallow-sea environments, respectively. Furthermore, an active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (ASTAR) aRIS architecture with independent beam control and adaptive beam-tracking mechanism integrating unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and acoustic intensity gradient sensing is proposed.

Branch prediction is a pattern recognition problem that learns mappings between a context to the branch outcome. An accurate predictor reduces the number of instructions executed on the wrong path resulting in an improvement of performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we present a workload characterization methodology for branch prediction. We propose two new workload-driven branch prediction accuracy identifiers -- branch working set size and branch predictability. These parameters are highly correlated with misprediction rates of modern branch prediction schemes (e.g. TAGE and perceptron). We define the branch working set of a trace as a group of most frequently occurring branch contexts, i.e. the 3-part tuple of branch address, and associated global and local history.

However, the data providers of this knowledge face a skewed tradeoff between income and risk: they receive little share of downstream value yet retain copyright and privacy liability, making them reluctant to contribute their assets to LLM services. Existing techniques do not offer a trustworthy and controllable way to use professional knowledge, because they keep providers in the dark and combine knowledge parameters with the underlying LLM backbone.\n  In this paper, we present PKUS, the Professional Knowledge Utilization System, which treats professional knowledge as a first-class, separable artifact.

Among sharing techniques, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) offers strong resource isolation by enabling hardware-level GPU partitioning. However, leveraging MIG effectively introduces new challenges. First, resource contention persists due to shared components such as PCIe bandwidth. Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration. Our approach dynamically adapts job placement to minimize contention and reorganizes GPU allocations to combat both internal and external fragmentation.

What am I looking at?, etc.). These devices will sense an egocentric view of the world around us to observe all human- relevant signals across space and time to construct and maintain a user's personal context. This personal context, combined with advanced generative AI, will unlock a powerful new generation of contextual AI personal assistants and applications. However, designing a wearable system to support contextual AI is a daunting task because of the system's complexity and stringent power constraints due to weight and battery restrictions. To understand how to guide design for such systems, this work provides the first complete system architecture view of one such wearable contextual AI system (Aria2), along with the lessons we have learned through the system modeling and design space exploration process. We show that an end-to-end full system model view of such systems is vitally important, as no single component or category overwhelmingly dominates system power. This means long-range design decisions and power optimizations need to be made in the full system context to avoid running into limits caused by other system bottlenecks (i.e., Amdahl's law as applied to power) or as bottlenecks change.

These \"setup times\" can wreak havoc on a system's queueing; this is especially true in modern systems, where servers are regularly turned on and off as a way to reduce operating costs (energy, labor, CO2, etc.). To design modern systems which are both efficient and performant, we need to understand how setup times affect queues.\n  Unfortunately, despite successes in understanding setup in a single-server system, setup in a multiserver system remains poorly understood. To circumvent the main difficulty in analyzing multiserver setup, all existing results assume that setup times are memoryless, i.e. distributed Exponentially. However, in most practical settings, setup times are close to Deterministic, and the widely used Exponential-setup assumption leads to unrealistic model behavior and a dramatic underestimation of the true harm caused by setup times.\n  This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the average waiting time in a multiserver system with Deterministic setup times, the M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the average waiting time in this system, and show these bounds are within a multiplicative constant of each other. These bounds are the first closed-form characterization of waiting time in any finite-server system with setup times. Further, we demonstrate how to combine our upper and lower bounds to derive a simple and accurate approximation for the average waiting time.

We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases.

To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently.\n  To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures.

While architectural abstractions offer a means to manage these systems, maintaining their consistency with the actual code has been problematic. The Java Platform Module System (JPMS), introduced in Java 9, addresses this limitation by enabling explicit module specification at the language level. JPMS enhances architectural implementation through improved encapsulation and direct specification of ground-truth architectures within Java projects. Although many projects are written in Java, modularizing existing monolithic projects to JPMS modules is an open challenge due to ineffective module recovery by existing architecture recovery techniques. To address this challenge, this paper presents ClassLAR (Class-and Language model-based Architectural Recovery), a novel, lightweight, and efficient approach that recovers Java modules from monolithic Java systems using fully-qualified class names. ClassLAR leverages language models to extract semantic information from package and class names, capturing both structural and functional intent. In evaluations across 20 popular Java projects, ClassLAR outperformed all state-of-the-art techniques in architectural-level similarity metrics while achieving execution times that were 3.99 to 10.50 times faster.", "AI": {"tldr": "ClassLAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u540d\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u67b6\u6784\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u5355\u4f53Java\u9879\u76ee\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e3aJPMS\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u6062\u590d\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301Java\u9879\u76ee\u5411JPMS\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5168\u9650\u5b9a\u7c7b\u540d\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u4e2a\u6d41\u884cJava\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\uff0cClassLAR\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53473.99\u81f310.50\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ClassLAR\u4e3aJava\u9879\u76ee\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86JPMS\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Building accurate performance models to navigate this vast space requires effective sampling strategies, yet existing methods often struggle with multi-objective optimization and cannot leverage semantic information from documentation. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivates the central question of this work: Can LLMs serve as effective samplers for multi-objective performance modeling? To explore this, we present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the capabilities and characteristics of LLM-driven sampling. We design and implement LLM4Perf, a feedback-based framework, and use it to systematically evaluate the LLM-guided sampling process across four highly configurable, real-world systems. Our study reveals that the LLM-guided approach outperforms traditional baselines in most cases. Quantitatively, LLM4Perf achieves the best performance in nearly 68.8% (77 out of 112) of all evaluation scenarios, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. We find this effectiveness stems from the LLM's dual capabilities of configuration space pruning and feedback-driven strategy refinement. The effectiveness of this pruning is further validated by the fact that it also improves the performance of the baseline methods in nearly 91.5% (410 out of 448) of cases. Furthermore, we show how the LLM choices for each component and hyperparameters within LLM4Perf affect its effectiveness. Overall, this paper provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of LLMs in performance engineering and offers concrete insights into the mechanisms that drive their success.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLLM4Perf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684LLM4Perf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "LLM4Perf\u572868.8%\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u526a\u679d\u4f7f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u572891.5%\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u6210\u529f\u6e90\u4e8e\u526a\u679d\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

While attractive for scalability, LaaJs tend to overlook domain specific issues raising concerns about their reliability in critical evaluation tasks. To better understand these limitations in practice, we examine LaaJ behavior in a concrete industrial use case: legacy code modernization via COBOL code generation. In this setting, we find that even production deployed LaaJs can miss domain critical errors, revealing consistent blind spots in their evaluation capabilities.\n  To better understand these blind spots, we analyze generated COBOL programs and associated LaaJs judgments, drawing on expert knowledge to construct a preliminary taxonomy. Based on this taxonomy, we develop a lightweight analytic checker tool that flags over 30 domain specific issues observed in practice.

Revisiting Automated Compiler Fault Isolation", "comment": "Accepted at ICSE'26", "summary": "Background: Compilers are fundamental to software development, translating high-level source code into executable software systems. Faults in compilers can have severe consequences and thus effective localization and resolution of compiler bugs are crucial. Problem: In practice, developers often examine version history to identify and investigate bug-inducing commit (BIC) for fixing bugs. However, while numerous sophisticated Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) techniques have been proposed for compiler fault isolation, their effectiveness has not been evaluated against the BIC-based strategies widely adopted in practice. Objective: This study aims to bridge this gap by directly comparing a BIC-based strategy, Basic, with representative SBFL techniques in the context of compiler fault localization. The BIC-based strategy closely aligns with common developer practices, as it directly identifies the BIC and treats the files modified in that commit as faulty candidates. Method: The Basic identifies the most recent good release and earliest bad release, and then employs a binary search to pinpoint the bug-inducing commit. All files modified in the identified commit are flagged as potentially faulty. We rigorously compare Basic against SBFL-based techniques using a benchmark consisting of 60 GCC bugs and 60 LLVM bugs. Result: Our analysis reveals that Basic performs comparably to, and in many cases outperforms, state-of-the-art SBFL-based techniques, particularly on the critical Top-1 and Top-5 ranking metrics. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into the practical effectiveness of SBFL-based techniques in real-world compiler debugging scenarios. We recommend that future research adopt Basic as a baseline when developing and evaluating new compiler fault isolation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eBIC\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0eSBFL\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0BIC\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u6216\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30SBFL\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u8c03\u8bd5\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684BIC\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u5206\u641c\u7d22\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5f15\u53d1\u6545\u969c\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4fee\u6539\u6587\u4ef6\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd460\u4e2aGCC\u548c60\u4e2aLLVM\u7f3a\u9677\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "BIC\u7b56\u7565\u5728Top-1\u548cTop-5\u6392\u540d\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdbSBFL\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5c06BIC\u7b56\u7565\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Its application to deep learning (DL) has expanded beyond classical testing to support tasks such as fault localization, repair, data generation, and model robustness evaluation. The core assumption is that mutants behave similarly to real faults, an assumption well established in traditional software systems but largely unverified for DL.\n  This study presents the first empirical comparison of pre-training and post-training mutation approaches in DL with respect to realism. We introduce a statistical framework to quantify their coupling strength and behavioral similarity to real faults using publicly available bugs datasets: CleanML, DeepFD, DeepLocalize, and defect4ML. Mutants are generated using state-of-the-art tools representing both approaches.\n  Results show that pre-training mutants exhibit consistently stronger coupling and higher behavioral similarity to real faults than post-training mutants, indicating greater realism.

Yet, where in the model this reliance resides, and how it affects performance, remains poorly understood. We present the first concept-level interpretability study of LLMs in SE, analyzing three tasks - code completion, translation, and refinement - through the lens of internal comment representation. Using Concept Activation Vectors (CAV), we show that LLMs not only internalize comments as distinct latent concepts but also differentiate between subtypes such as Javadocs, inline, and multiline comments. By systematically activating and deactivating these concepts in the LLMs' embedding space, we observed significant, model-specific, and task-dependent shifts in performance ranging from -90% to +67%. Finally, we conducted a controlled experiment using the same set of code inputs, prompting LLMs to perform 10 distinct SE tasks while measuring the activation of the comment concept within their latent representations. We found that code summarization consistently triggered the strongest activation of comment concepts, whereas code completion elicited the weakest sensitivity.
