### [1] [Advanced Vulnerability Scanning for Open Source Software: Detection and Mitigation of Log4j Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00235)
*Victor Wen,Zedong Peng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种先进的Log4j漏洞扫描工具，通过评估实际可利用性降低误报率，并集成GitHub Actions实现自动化持续扫描。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Log4Shell检测工具主要依赖版本识别，导致大量误报，无法准确判断软件是否真正易受攻击。

Method: 工具先识别漏洞，再提供针对性修复建议与即时反馈，并利用GitHub Actions实现自动化持续扫描。

Result: 在28个开源项目、140次扫描中达到91.4%的准确率，工具已发布于GitHub Marketplace供公众使用。

Conclusion: 该工具为开源项目提供了可靠、高效的漏洞检测与缓解方案，显著提升软件安全性。

Abstract: Automated detection of software vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge in software security. Log4j is an industrial-grade Java logging framework listed as one of the top 100 critical open source projects. On Dec. 10, 2021 a severe vulnerability Log4Shell was disclosed before being fully patched with Log4j2 version 2.17.0 on Dec. 18, 2021. However, to this day about 4.1 million, or 33 percent of all Log4j downloads in the last 7 days contain vulnerable packages. Many Log4Shell scanners have since been created to detect if a user's installed Log4j version is vulnerable. Current detection tools primarily focus on identifying the version of Log4j installed, leading to numerous false positives, as they do not check if the software scanned is really vulnerable to malicious actors. This research aims to develop an advanced Log4j scanning tool that can evaluate the real-world exploitability of the software, thereby reducing false positives. Our approach first identifies vulnerabilities and then provides targeted recommendations for mitigating these detected vulnerabilities, along with instant feedback to users. By leveraging GitHub Actions, our tool offers automated and continuous scanning capabilities, ensuring timely identification of vulnerabilities as code changes occur. This integration into existing development workflows enables real-time monitoring and quicker responses to potential threats. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating 28 open-source software projects across different releases, achieving an accuracy rate of 91.4% from a sample of 140 scans. Our GitHub action implementation is available at the GitHub marketplace and can be accessed by anyone interested in improving their software security and for future studies. This tool provides a dependable way to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in open-source projects.

### [2] [In Line with Context: Repository-Level Code Generation via Context Inlining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00376)
*Chao Hu,Wenhao Zeng,Yuling Shi,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: InlineCoder通过将未完成函数内联到调用图中，将复杂的仓库级代码生成简化为函数级任务，结合上下游依赖增强上下文理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RAG难以捕捉仓库内复杂语义依赖，需更有效的上下文建模方式。

Method: 提出双向内联框架：上游内联嵌入调用者以捕获使用场景，下游检索引入被调用者提供依赖上下文，并利用锚点草稿估计置信度。

Result: 该方法使LLM获得更全面的仓库视角，显著提升仓库级代码生成能力。

Conclusion: InlineCoder有效解决了仓库级代码生成中的依赖建模难题，为大规模代码生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Repository-level code generation has attracted growing attention in recent years. Unlike function-level code generation, it requires the model to understand the entire repository, reasoning over complex dependencies across functions, classes, and modules. However, existing approaches such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or context-based function selection often fall short: they primarily rely on surface-level similarity and struggle to capture the rich dependencies that govern repository-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce InlineCoder, a novel framework for repository-level code generation. InlineCoder enhances the understanding of repository context by inlining the unfinished function into its call graph, thereby reframing the challenging repository understanding as an easier function-level coding task. Given a function signature, InlineCoder first generates a draft completion, termed an anchor, which approximates downstream dependencies and enables perplexity-based confidence estimation. This anchor drives a bidirectional inlining process: (i) Upstream Inlining, which embeds the anchor into its callers to capture diverse usage scenarios; and (ii) Downstream Retrieval, which integrates the anchor's callees into the prompt to provide precise dependency context. The enriched context, combining draft completion with upstream and downstream perspectives, equips the LLM with a comprehensive repository view.

### [4] [DSL or Code? Evaluating the Quality of LLM-Generated Algebraic Specifications: A Case Study in Optimization at Kinaxis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00469)
*Negin Ayoughi,David Dewar,Shiva Nejati,Mehrdad Sabetzadeh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出EXEOS方法，利用大语言模型从自然语言描述生成AMPL模型和Python代码，并通过求解器反馈迭代优化，实验证明AMPL在某些场景下优于Python。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低模型驱动工程中建模与维护成本，解决领域特定语言在大语言模型生成中的准确性不足问题。

Method: 基于大语言模型构建EXEOS框架，从自然语言生成AMPL和Python代码，结合求解器反馈进行迭代精炼。

Result: 在公开数据集和实际供应链案例中，AMPL模型在可执行性和正确性上与Python相当甚至更优，且EXEOS设计有效提升生成质量。

Conclusion: EXEOS证明了大语言模型支持DSL建模的可行性，为模型驱动工程提供了更具成本效益的新路径。

Abstract: Model-driven engineering (MDE) provides abstraction and analytical rigour, but industrial adoption in many domains has been limited by the cost of developing and maintaining models. Large language models (LLMs) can help shift this cost balance by supporting direct generation of models from natural-language (NL) descriptions. For domain-specific languages (DSLs), however, LLM-generated models may be less accurate than LLM-generated code in mainstream languages such as Python, due to the latter's dominance in LLM training corpora. We investigate this issue in mathematical optimization, with AMPL, a DSL with established industrial use. We introduce EXEOS, an LLM-based approach that derives AMPL models and Python code from NL problem descriptions and iteratively refines them with solver feedback. Using a public optimization dataset and real-world supply-chain cases from our industrial partner Kinaxis, we evaluate generated AMPL models against Python code in terms of executability and correctness. An ablation study with two LLM families shows that AMPL is competitive with, and sometimes better than, Python, and that our design choices in EXEOS improve the quality of generated specifications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出首个自动化协同重命名的多智能体框架，通过智能体与开发者协作减轻重复性工作负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协同重命名任务繁琐且易错，现有工具假阳性高或建议不完整，亟需更高效可靠方案。

Method: 设计三智能体框架：范围推断智能体解析开发者初始重构意图，计划执行智能体依计划调用IDE API安全执行，复制智能体指导项目级搜索。

Result: 在100个开源项目60.9万次提交中验证方法有效性，并通过205名开发者调研确认实用性。

Conclusion: AI智能体应作为开发者能力延伸而非替代，本框架成功实现人机协作下的高效协同重命名。

Abstract: The primary value of AI agents in software development lies in their ability to extend the developer's capacity for reasoning and action, not to supplant human involvement. To showcase how to use agents working in tandem with developers, we designed a novel approach for carrying out coordinated renaming. Coordinated renaming, where a single rename refactoring triggers refactorings in multiple, related identifiers, is a frequent yet challenging task. Developers must manually propagate these rename refactorings across numerous files and contexts, a process that is both tedious and highly error-prone. State-of-the-art heuristic-based approaches produce an overwhelming number of false positives, while vanilla Large Language Models (LLMs) provide incomplete suggestions due to their limited context and inability to interact with refactoring tools. This leaves developers with incomplete refactorings or burdens them with filtering too many false positives. Coordinated renaming is exactly the kind of repetitive task that agents can significantly reduce the developers' burden while keeping them in the driver's seat.
  We designed, implemented, and evaluated the first multi-agent framework that automates coordinated renaming. It operates on a key insight: a developer's initial refactoring is a clue to infer the scope of related refactorings. Our Scope Inference Agent first transforms this clue into an explicit, natural-language Declared Scope. The Planned Execution Agent then uses this as a strict plan to identify program elements that should undergo refactoring and safely executes the changes by invoking the IDE's own trusted refactoring APIs. Finally, the Replication Agent uses it to guide the project-wide search. We first conducted a formative study on the practice of coordinated renaming in 609K commits in 100 open-source projects and surveyed 205 developers ...

### [6] [STELLAR: A Search-Based Testing Framework for Large Language Model Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00497)
*Lev Sorokin,Ivan Vasilev,Ken E. Friedl,Andrea Stocco*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: STELLAR是一个自动化搜索测试框架，用于发现LLM应用中的不当响应输入，通过进化优化方法显著提升故障检测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM应用易产生不准确或有害响应，且高维输入空间使系统性测试困难，亟需高效测试方法。

Method: 将测试生成建模为优化问题，离散化输入空间特征，并采用进化优化动态探索易引发故障的特征组合。

Result: 在三个LLM问答系统上评估，STELLAR比现有基线方法平均多发现2.5倍故障，最高达4.3倍。

Conclusion: STELLAR能有效暴露LLM应用潜在故障，为高维输入空间提供了一种高效、自动化的测试解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based applications are increasingly deployed across various domains, including customer service, education, and mobility. However, these systems are prone to inaccurate, fictitious, or harmful responses, and their vast, high-dimensional input space makes systematic testing particularly challenging. To address this, we present STELLAR, an automated search-based testing framework for LLM-based applications that systematically uncovers text inputs leading to inappropriate system responses. Our framework models test generation as an optimization problem and discretizes the input space into stylistic, content-related, and perturbation features. Unlike prior work that focuses on prompt optimization or coverage heuristics, our work employs evolutionary optimization to dynamically explore feature combinations that are more likely to expose failures. We evaluate STELLAR on three LLM-based conversational question-answering systems. The first focuses on safety, benchmarking both public and proprietary LLMs against malicious or unsafe prompts. The second and third target navigation, using an open-source and an industrial retrieval-augmented system for in-vehicle venue recommendations. Overall, STELLAR exposes up to 4.3 times (average 2.5 times) more failures than the existing baseline approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决在海量模型中难以识别适用于软件工程任务模型的问题，构建专用目录。

Method: 结合自动化收集、人工标注和大语言模型辅助验证，从Hugging Face提取3427个模型并关联到软件开发生命周期中的任务。

Result: 构建了标准化、可支持多用途的SE模型数据集SEMOS。

Conclusion: SEMOS填补了软件工程领域缺乏专用AI模型目录的空白，有助于推动AI在软件工程中的整合与应用。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence into Software Engineering (SE) requires having a curated collection of models suited to SE tasks. With millions of models hosted on Hugging Face (HF) and new ones continuously being created, it is infeasible to identify SE models without a dedicated catalogue. To address this gap, we present SEMODS: an SE-focused dataset of 3,427 models extracted from HF, combining automated collection with rigorous validation through manual annotation and large language model assistance. Our dataset links models to SE tasks and activities from the software development lifecycle, offering a standardized representation of their evaluation results, and supporting multiple applications such as data analysis, model discovery, benchmarking, and model adaptation.

### [8] [A-FC: An Activity-Based Delay Tolerant Routing Protocol for Improving Future School Campus Emergency Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00148)
*Chengjun Jiang,Milena Radenkovic*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出基于活动性的A-FC协议，显著提升校园灾备通信的投递率与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DTN协议在灾害导致通信中断时表现不佳，需更可靠方案保障校园安全。

Method: 设计A-FC协议，强制将消息上传至高活跃度的“教职工节点”，利用社会角色优化路由。

Result: 仿真显示投递率达68%，平均延迟降至4311秒，平均跳数仅1.68。

Conclusion: A-FC协议为校园灾害响应提供了低成本、高可靠的备用通信模型。

Abstract: School Campus emergency communication systems are vital for safeguarding student safety during sudden disasters such as typhoons, which frequently cause widespread paralysis of communication infrastructure. Traditional Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN) protocols, such as Direct Delivery and First Contact, struggle to maintain reliable connections in such scenarios due to high latency and low delivery rates. This paper proposes the Activity-based First Contact (A-FC) protocol, an innovative routing scheme that leverages real-world social roles to overcome network partitioning by mandatorily uploading messages to highly active "staff nodes". We constructed a real-world evaluation scenario based on the topology of Fuzhou No. 1 Middle School. Simulation results demonstrate that the A-FC protocol significantly outperforms baseline protocols, achieving approximately 68% message delivery probability and reducing average delay to 4311 seconds. With an average hop count of merely 1.68, this protocol establishes a low-cost, highly reliable backup communication model for school campus disaster response.

TL;DR: MAESTRO是一个用于评估基于LLM的多智能体系统（MAS）测试性、可靠性和可观测性的标准化工具套件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决MAS在结构稳定性与时间变异性之间的矛盾，提供统一评测框架以指导系统设计优化。

Method: 通过统一接口标准化MAS配置与执行，集成原生及第三方MAS，导出框架无关的执行轨迹与系统级信号，并在12个代表性MAS上进行控制实验。

Result: 发现MAS架构是资源消耗、可复现性及成本-延迟-准确率权衡的主要决定因素，其影响常超过后端模型或工具配置的变化。

Conclusion: MAESTRO支持对MAS的系统化评估，为构建和优化智能体系统提供实证依据。

Abstract: We present MAESTRO, an evaluation suite for the testing, reliability, and observability of LLM-based MAS. MAESTRO standardizes MAS configuration and execution through a unified interface, supports integrating both native and third-party MAS via a repository of examples and lightweight adapters, and exports framework-agnostic execution traces together with system-level signals (e.g., latency, cost, and failures). We instantiate MAESTRO with 12 representative MAS spanning popular agentic frameworks and interaction patterns, and conduct controlled experiments across repeated runs, backend models, and tool configurations. Our case studies show that MAS executions can be structurally stable yet temporally variable, leading to substantial run-to-run variance in performance and reliability. We further find that MAS architecture is the dominant driver of resource profiles, reproducibility, and cost-latency-accuracy trade-off, often outweighing changes in backend models or tool settings. Overall, MAESTRO enables systematic evaluation and provides empirical guidance for designing and optimizing agentic systems.

*Akash Kumar,Sourav Dutta,Goutam Das*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出一种新型调度框架，用于TWDM EPON前传系统，避免注册过程占用专用波长，显著提升支持的RU数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EPON注册过程会中断数据传输，违反eCPRI时延和抖动要求，而ITU-T推荐的专用波长方案导致带宽利用率低下。

Method: 设计一种适用于TWDM EPON前传系统的周期性注册调度框架，无需额外波长通道即可完成注册。

Result: 与使用专用注册波长的基线方案相比，所提方法在相同波长信道数下可支持的RU数量提升高达71%。

Conclusion: 该调度框架有效解决EPON前传系统注册效率问题，在满足严苛时延要求的同时显著提升资源利用率。

Abstract: The adoption of Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architectures requires fronthaul systems capable of carrying large volumes of radio data while meeting stringent delay and jitter requirements. Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPONs) have emerged as a promising fronthaul solution due to their cost efficiency and compatibility with existing infrastructure. However, the traditional registration process for EPON systems halts the ongoing data transmissions during the registration period, thereby violating the enhanced Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI) delay and jitter requirements. This limitation has been acknowledged by the ITU-T, which recommends the use of a dedicated wavelength channel for registration, leading to inefficient bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduling framework for a Time and Wavelength Division Multiplexed (TWDM) EPON-based fronthaul that enables periodic registration without wasting an additional wavelength channel. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method achieves up to a 71\% increase in the number of Radio Units (RUs) supported for a given number of wavelength channels, compared to a baseline scheme employing a dedicated registration wavelength.

### [11] [Enhancing Reliability of STT-MRAM Caches by Eliminating Read Disturbance Accumulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00450)
*Elham Cheshmikhani,Hamed Farbeh,Hossein Asadi*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 本文提出REAP-cache方案，有效消除STT-MRAM缓存中读扰动累积问题，显著提升可靠性且几乎不影响性能与功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STT-MRAM缓存因并行读取未校验ECC的块导致读扰动错误累积，严重降低可靠性，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出REAP-cache机制，在不牺牲性能前提下阻止读扰动累积，仅对请求块进行ECC校验。

Result: 实验表明REAP-cache使缓存平均故障间隔时间提升171倍，面积增加<1%，能耗仅增2.7%。

Conclusion: REAP-cache能高效解决STT-MRAM缓存可靠性问题，是兼顾性能与可靠性的实用方案。

Abstract: Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) as one of the most promising replacements for SRAMs in on-chip cache memories benefits from higher density and scalability, near-zero leakage power, and non-volatility, but its reliability is threatened by high read disturbance error rate. Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are conventionally suggested to overcome the read disturbance errors in STT-MRAM caches. By employing aggressive ECCs and checking out a cache block on every read access, a high level of cache reliability is achieved. However, to minimize the cache access time in modern processors, all blocks in the target cache set are simultaneously read in parallel for tags comparison operation and only the requested block is sent out, if any, after checking its ECC. These extra cache block reads without checking their ECCs until requesting the blocks by the processor cause the accumulation of read disturbance error, which significantly degrade the cache reliability. In this paper, we first introduce and formulate the read disturbance accumulation phenomenon and reveal that this accumulation due to conventional parallel accesses of cache blocks significantly increases the cache error rate. Then, we propose a simple yet effective scheme, so-called Read Error Accumulation Preventer cache (REAP-cache), to completely eliminate the accumulation of read disturbances without compromising the cache performance. Our evaluations show that the proposed REAP-cache extends the cache Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) by 171x, while increases the cache area by less than 1% and energy consumption by only 2.7%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STT-MRAM因高错误率限制其在片上缓存中的应用，传统ECC效率低下。

Method: 通过分析数据相关错误模式，设计新型ECC方案ROBIN。

Result: ROBIN将缓存错误率降低超过28.6倍，相比传统ECC平均提升151.7%。

Conclusion: ROBIN有效提升了STT-MRAM在片上缓存中的纠错能力与实用性。

Abstract: Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM} (STT-MRAM) is a promising alternative for SRAMs in on-chip cache memories. Besides all its advantages, high error rate in STT-MRAM is a major limiting factor for on-chip cache memories. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive analysis that reveals that the conventional Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) lose their efficiency due to data-dependent error patterns, and then propose an efficient ECC configuration, so-called ROBIN, to improve the correction capability. The evaluations show that the inefficiency of conventional ECC increases the cache error rate by an average of 151.7% while ROBIN reduces this value by more than 28.6x.

Result: 实验表明，随着Map和Reduce函数数量增加，执行时间减少，程序整体效率不同程度提升。

Conclusion: 确定最优Map/Reduce函数数量可帮助企业和开发者制定更优解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing demand for high-performance and high-efficiency computing, cloud computing, especially serverless computing, has gradually become a research hotspot in recent years, attracting numerous research attention. Meanwhile, MapReduce, which is a popular big data processing model in the industry, has been widely applied in various fields. Inspired by the serverless framework of Function as a Service and the high concurrency and robustness of MapReduce programming model, this paper focus on combining them to reduce the time span and increase the efficiency when executing the word frequency counting task. In this case, the paper use a MapReduce programming model based on a serverless computing platform to figure out the most optimized number of Map functions and Reduce functions for a particular task. For the same amount of workload, extensive experiments show both execution time reduces and the overall efficiency of the program improves at different rates as the number of map functions and reduce functions increases. This paper suppose the discovery of the most optimized number of map and reduce functions can help cooperations and programmers figure out the most optimized solutions.

TL;DR: Revati 是一种时间扭曲模拟器，通过直接执行真实服务系统代码实现高效性能建模，无需物理 GPU 且速度提升5-17倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为降低 LLM 部署时测试数百种配置所需的时间与成本，同时避免重新实现控制逻辑的负担。

Method: 拦截 CUDA API 调用以虚拟化设备管理，使用时间跳跃代替实际 GPU 内核执行，并通过分布式协调协议保持因果性。

Result: 在 vLLM 和 SGLang 上预测误差小于 5%，运行速度比真实 GPU 快 5-17 倍。

Conclusion: Revati 在保证精度的同时显著提升效率，适用于快速迭代的 LLM 服务框架性能评估。

Abstract: Deploying LLMs efficiently requires testing hundreds of serving configurations, but evaluating each one on a GPU cluster takes hours and costs thousands of dollars. Discrete-event simulators are faster and cheaper, but they require re-implementing the serving system's control logic -- a burden that compounds as frameworks evolve.
  We present Revati, a time-warp emulator that enables performance modeling by directly executing real serving system code at simulation-like speed. The system intercepts CUDA API calls to virtualize device management, allowing serving frameworks to run without physical GPUs. Instead of executing GPU kernels, it performs time jumps -- fast-forwarding virtual time by predicted kernel durations. We propose a coordination protocol that synchronizes these jumps across distributed processes while preserving causality. On vLLM and SGLang, Revati achieves less than 5% prediction error across multiple models and parallelism configurations, while running 5-17x faster than real GPU execution.

Motivation: 零售业数字化转型加速云POS系统采用，但缺乏针对零售工作负载的平台性能实证研究。

Method: 使用免费层云资源，通过实时API端点和开源基准代码，在GCP与Azure上系统比较POS工作负载，测量响应延迟、吞吐量、可扩展性及估算运营成本。

Result: GCP在基线负载下响应时间快23.0%，Azure在稳态运行中成本效率高71.9%。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了首个面向零售云应用的开放基准方法，并为商户提供基于架构差异的云POS实施决策框架。

Abstract: Althoughthereislittleempiricalresearchonplatform-specific performance for retail workloads, the digital transformation of the retail industry has accelerated the adoption of cloud-based Point-of-Sale (POS) systems. This paper presents a systematic, repeatable comparison of POS workload deployments on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure using real-time API endpoints and open-source benchmarking code. Using free-tier cloud resources, we offer a transparent methodology for POS workload evaluation that small retailers and researchers can use. Our approach measures important performance metrics like response latency, throughput, and scalability while estimating operational costs based on actual resource usage and current public cloud pricing because there is no direct billing under free-tier usage. All the tables and figures in this study are generated directly from code outputs, ensuring that the experimental data and the reported results are consistent. Our analysis shows that GCP achieves 23.0% faster response times at baseline load, while Azure shows 71.9% higher cost efficiency for steady-state operations. We look at the architectural components that lead to these differences and provide a helpful framework for merchants considering cloud point-of-sale implementation. This study establishes a strong, open benchmarking methodology for retail cloud applications and offers the first comprehensive, code-driven comparison of workloads unique to point-of-sale systems across leading cloud platforms.

Conclusion: FlexSpec有效解决了边缘计算中模型演化与资源约束带来的协同推理瓶颈，具备良好的实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in mobile and edge computing environments is constrained by limited on-device resources, scarce wireless bandwidth, and frequent model evolution. Although edge-cloud collaborative inference with speculative decoding (SD) can reduce end-to-end latency by executing a lightweight draft model at the edge and verifying it with a cloud-side target model, existing frameworks fundamentally rely on tight coupling between the two models. Consequently, repeated model synchronization introduces excessive communication overhead, increasing end-to-end latency, and ultimately limiting the scalability of SD in edge environments. To address these limitations, we propose FlexSpec, a communication-efficient collaborative inference framework tailored for evolving edge-cloud systems. The core design of FlexSpec is a shared-backbone architecture that allows a single and static edge-side draft model to remain compatible with a large family of evolving cloud-side target models. By decoupling edge deployment from cloud-side model updates, FlexSpec eliminates the need for edge-side retraining or repeated model downloads, substantially reducing communication and maintenance costs. Furthermore, to accommodate time-varying wireless conditions and heterogeneous device constraints, we develop a channel-aware adaptive speculation mechanism that dynamically adjusts the speculative draft length based on real-time channel state information and device energy budgets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexSpec achieves superior performance compared to conventional SD approaches in terms of inference efficiency.

Motivation: 解决传统FIPA-ACL协议语义丰富但资源开销大、IoT协议轻量但表达力弱的矛盾。

Method: 形式化RCAC模型，定义四动词基元，结合TLA+与Coq验证安全性与有界性，并进行大规模仿真。

Result: 证明四动词可编码FIPA协议，实现部分同步下共识，中位延迟34ms，优于现有协议。

Conclusion: μACP为资源受限多智能体系统提供了兼顾表达力与效率的严谨理论基础。

Abstract: Agent communication remains a foundational problem in multi-agent systems: protocols such as FIPA-ACL guarantee semantic richness but are intractable for constrained environments, while lightweight IoT protocols achieve efficiency at the expense of expressiveness. This paper presents $μ$ACP, a formal calculus for expressive agent communication under explicit resource bounds. We formalize the Resource-Constrained Agent Communication (RCAC) model, prove that a minimal four-verb basis \textit{\{PING, TELL, ASK, OBSERVE\}} is suffices to encode finite-state FIPA protocols, and establish tight information-theoretic bounds on message complexity. We further show that $μ$ACP can implement standard consensus under partial synchrony and crash faults, yielding a constructive coordination framework for edge-native agents. Formal verification in TLA$^{+}$ (model checking) and Coq (mechanized invariants) establishes safety and boundedness, and supports liveness under modeled assumptions. Large-scale system simulations confirm ACP achieves a median end-to-end message latency of 34 ms (95th percentile 104 ms) at scale, outperforming prior agent and IoT protocols under severe resource constraints. The main contribution is a unified calculus that reconciles semantic expressiveness with provable efficiency, providing a rigorous foundation for the next generation of resource-constrained multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 需跨学科合作开发适用于AI环境的新型反合谋框架，以防范有害协调行为。

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems become increasingly autonomous, evidence shows they can develop collusive strategies similar to those long observed in human markets and institutions. While human domains have accumulated centuries of anti-collusion mechanisms, it remains unclear how these can be adapted to AI settings. This paper addresses that gap by (i) developing a taxonomy of human anti-collusion mechanisms, including sanctions, leniency & whistleblowing, monitoring & auditing, market design, and governance and (ii) mapping them to potential interventions for multi-agent AI systems. For each mechanism, we propose implementation approaches. We also highlight open challenges, such as the attribution problem (difficulty attributing emergent coordination to specific agents) identity fluidity (agents being easily forked or modified) the boundary problem (distinguishing beneficial cooperation from harmful collusion) and adversarial adaptation (agents learning to evade detection).
