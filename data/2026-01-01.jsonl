In the domain of TCAD simulation, however, the scarcity of open-source resources hinders language models from generating valid TCAD code. To overcome this limitation, we construct an open-source TCAD dataset curated by experts and fine-tune a domain-specific model for TCAD code generation. Building on this foundation, we propose AgenticTCAD, a natural language - driven multi-agent framework that enables end-to-end automated device design and optimization. Validation on a 2 nm nanosheet FET (NS-FET) design shows that AgenticTCAD achieves the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS)-2024 device specifications within 4.2 hours, whereas human experts required 7.1 days with commercial tools."}

We introduce Hybrid-Code, a hybrid neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for local clinical coding that ensures production reliability through redundancy and verification. Our system comprises two agents: a Coder that attempts language model-based semantic reasoning using BioMistral-7B but falls back to deterministic keyword matching when model output is unreliable, ensuring pipeline completion; and an Auditor that verifies codes against a 257-code knowledge base and clinical evidence. Evaluating on 1,000 MIMIC-III discharge summaries, we demonstrate no hallucinated codes among accepted outputs within the knowledge base, 24.47% verification rate, and 34.11% coverage (95% CI: 31.2%--37.0%) with 86%+ language model utilization. The Auditor filtered invalid format codes and provided evidence-based quality control (75.53% rejection rate) while ensuring no patient data leaves the hospital firewall. The hybrid architecture -- combining language model semantic understanding (when successful), deterministic fallback (when the model fails), and symbolic verification (always active) -- ensures both reliability and privacy preservation, addressing critical barriers to AI adoption in healthcare. Our key finding is that reliability through redundancy is more valuable than pure model performance in production healthcare systems, where system failures are unacceptable."}

DEFT introduces a mathematically grounded reparameterization that aligns the expected continuous objective with discrete fault-detection semantics, enabling reliable gradient-based pattern generation. To ensure scalability and stability on deep circuit graphs, DEFT integrates a custom CUDA kernel for efficient forward-backward propagation and applies gradient normalization to mitigate vanishing gradients. Compared to a leading commercial tool on two industrial benchmarks, DEFT improves HTD fault detection by 21.1% and 48.9% on average under the same pattern budget and comparable runtime. DEFT also supports practical ATPG settings such as partial assignment pattern generation, producing patterns with 19.3% fewer 0/1 bits while still detecting 35% more faults.

We observe, however, that GPU memory access patterns are inherently predictable via kernel launch arguments and their asynchronous execution nature. Leveraging this, we propose MSched, an OS-level scheduler that extends GPU context switching to include proactive working set preparation, thereby coalescing fragmented, eventual, and expensive page faults into a single efficient migration. MSched employs a template-based approach to predict working sets with near-perfect accuracy and proposes a co-design between task scheduler and memory manager to enforce a globally optimal page placement policy. Evaluation demonstrates that MSched outperforms demand paging by up to 11.05x for scientific and deep learning workloads, and 57.88x for LLM under memory oversubscription."}

However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, \"getting right\" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact. When compared against the state-of-the-art Popcorn compiler, Unifico reduces binary size overhead from ~200% to ~10%, whilst eliminating the stack transformation overhead during ISA migration."}

GPUs offer massive parallelism that can potentially accelerate SPHINCS+ signatures. However, existing GPU-based optimizations either fail to fully exploit the inherent parallelism of SPHINCS+'s Merkle tree structure or lack fine-grained, compiler-level customization across its diverse computational kernels. This paper proposes HERO Sign, a GPU-accelerated SPHINCS+ implementation that adopts hierarchical tuning and efficient compiler time optimizations. HERO Sign reexamines the parallelization opportunities enabled by data independence across SPHINCS+ components, including FORS, MSS, and WOTS+. It introduces a Tree Fusion strategy for FORS, which contains a large number of independent branches. The fusion strategy is guided by an automated Tree Tuning search algorithm that adapts fusion schemes to different GPU architectures. To further improve performance, HERO Sign employs an adaptive compilation strategy that accounts for the varying effectiveness of compiler optimizations across SPHINCS+ kernels such as FORS Sign, TREE Sign, and WOTS+ Sign. During compilation, the strategy automatically selects between PTX and native code paths to maximize efficiency. For batched signature generation, HERO Sign optimizes kernel-level overlapping using a task graph-based construction to reduce multi-stream idle time and kernel launch overhead. Experimental results show that, compared to state of the art GPU implementations, HERO Sign achieves throughput improvements of 1.28-3.13, 1.28-2.92, and 1.24-2.60 under the SPHINCS+ 128f, 192f, and 256f parameter sets on RTX 4090.

In Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform, specialized agents analyze pipeline telemetry and metadata, reason over declarative cost and compliance policies, and propose constrained operational actions such as adaptive resource reconfiguration, schema reconciliation, and automated failure recovery. All agent actions are validated against governance policies to ensure predictable and auditable behavior. We evaluate Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform using representative batch and streaming analytics workloads constructed from public enterprise-style datasets. Experimental results show that Agentic Cloud Data Engineering platform reduces mean pipeline recovery time by up to 45%, lowers operational cost by approximately 25%, and decreases manual intervention events by over 70% compared to static orchestration, while maintaining data freshness and policy compliance.

A system violates individual fairness if there exists a pair of inputs differing only in protected attributes (such as race or gender) that lead to significantly different outcomes-for example, one favorable and the other unfavorable. While this notion highlights isolated instances of unfairness, it fails to capture broader patterns of systematic or clustered discrimination that may affect entire subgroups. We introduce and motivate the concept of discrimination clustering, a generalization of individual fairness violations. Rather than detecting single counterfactual disparities, we seek to uncover regions of the input space where small perturbations in protected features lead to k-significantly distinct clusters of outcomes. That is, for a given input, we identify a local neighborhood-differing only in protected attributes-whose members' outputs separate into many distinct clusters. These clusters reveal significant arbitrariness in treatment solely based on protected attributes that help expose patterns of algorithmic bias that elude pairwise fairness checks. We present HyFair, a hybrid technique that combines formal symbolic analysis (via SMT and MILP solvers) to certify individual fairness with randomized search to discover discriminatory clusters. This combination enables both formal guarantees-when no counterexamples exist-and the detection of severe violations that are computationally challenging for symbolic methods alone. Given a set of inputs exhibiting high k-unfairness, we introduce a novel explanation method to generate interpretable, decision-tree-style artifacts. Our experiments demonstrate that HyFair outperforms state-of-the-art fairness verification and local explanation methods."}

The WMFM is pretrained using contrastive learning, a self-supervised learning technique that aligns embeddings of camera and channel data without requiring explicit labels. The pretrained encoders are then frozen and employed as feature extractors, with lightweight task-specific heads, fine-tuned for downstream tasks, including user localization and LoS/nLoS classification.

To make this synthesis tractable, Vulcan separates policy and mechanism through LLM-friendly, task-agnostic interfaces. With these interfaces, users specify the inputs and objectives of their desired policy, while Vulcan searches for performant policies via evolutionary search over LLM-generated code. This interface is expressive enough to capture a wide range of system policies, yet sufficiently constrained to allow even small, inexpensive LLMs to generate correct and executable code.\n  We use Vulcan to synthesize performant heuristics for cache eviction and memory tiering, and find that these heuristics outperform all human-designed state-of-the-art algorithms by upto 69% and 7.9% in performance for each of these tasks respectively."}

Using this model and a queueing-based delay formulation, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly minimize system latency and power consumption, which is shown to be NP-hard. The problem is decomposed into tractable convex subproblems and solved through a two-stage container-based resource management scheme (CRMS) combining convex optimization and greedy refinement.

This paper tackles that problem, providing a broad literature review on the advancements of key WiFi features to date. This paper will center on seven key areas of focus: (1) bandwidth, (2) battery life, (3) traffic collisions, (4) interference, (5) data-intensive transmissions, (6) numerous devices, and (7) peak throughput/modulation. Each section will focus on WiFi's problems, how those problems were fixed, as well as the limitations of existing solutions. Moreover, the paper explains the role of new unreleased technologies in these seven areas. This includes exploring the upcoming WiFi 8 standard based on the IEEE 802.11bn \"Ultra High Reliability\" (UHR) specification and how it builds upon current specifications. Compared to previous specifications, WiFi 8 marks a stronger and more significant shift toward prioritizing reliability over pure data rates. Beyond a sole literature review, this paper uses a novel analogy. A road/highway analogy will be integrated throughout the paper to facilitate understanding of networking mechanisms. This paper is approachable and is written such that someone with very little WiFi knowledge should come away with a strong understanding of WiFi.

This paper first presents a theoretical analysis of the impact of client data heterogeneity on global model generalization error, which can result in repeated training cycles, increased energy consumption, and prolonged latency. Based on the theoretical insights, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize learning latency and energy consumption while constraining generalization error.

Methods: We develop a classification framework to organize research on software fairness from a fresh perspective, applying it to 95 selected studies and analyzing their potential for industrial adoption. Results: Our findings reveal that software fairness research is expanding, yet it remains heavily focused on methods and algorithms. It primarily focuses on post-processing and group fairness, with less emphasis on early-stage interventions, individual fairness metrics, and understanding bias root causes. Additionally fairness research remains largely academic, with limited industry collaboration and low to medium Technology Readiness Level (TRL), indicating that industrial transferability remains distant.

Rather than adapting established sender-driven reliable unicast mechanisms to multicast, as most contemporaneous proposals did, SRM introduced a data-centric model in which data receivers recover losses by explicitly requesting missing data. Thirty years later, we revisit the SRM framework, examining the challenges it faced, the lessons learned, and its influence on the later development of Named Data Networking (NDN). Experimentations with SRM revealed a fundamental semantic mismatch between its data-centric framework and IP's address-based delivery; while the application layer named data, the network layer remained 'blind' to those names, resulting in inefficient loss recovery. NDN resolves this architectural friction by aligning network delivery with the data-retrieval model and by securing data directly rather than securing communication channels.

Current benchmarks, focused on code correctness, fail to capture the nuanced, interactive behaviors essential for successful human-AI partnership. To bridge this evaluation gap, this paper makes two core contributions. First, we present a foundational taxonomy of desirable agent behaviors for enterprise software engineering, derived from an analysis of 91 sets of user-defined agent rules. This taxonomy defines four key expectations of agent behavior: Adhere to Standards and Processes, Ensure Code Quality and Reliability, Solving Problems Effectively, and Collaborating with the User.\n  Second, recognizing that these expectations are not static, we introduce the Context-Adaptive Behavior (CAB) Framework. This emerging framework reveals how behavioral expectations shift along two empirically-derived axes: the Time Horizon (from immediate needs to future ideals), established through interviews with 15 expert engineers, and the Type of Work (from enterprise production to rapid prototyping, for example), identified through a prompt analysis of a prototyping agent. Together, these contributions offer a human-centered foundation for designing and evaluating the next generation of AI agents, moving the field's focus from the correctness of generated code toward the dynamics of true collaborative intelligence."}

Fog computing addresses this by placing computation near the network edge. However, limited and heterogeneous fog resources pose reliability challenges, especially for mission-critical applications. On the other hand, to improve flexibility, applications are deployed as Service Function Chains (SFCs), where each function runs as a Virtual Network Function (VNF). While scalable, this approach is more failure-prone than monolithic deployments, necessitating intelligent redundancy and placement strategies. This paper addresses the reliability-aware SFC placement problem over heterogeneous fog servers through the lens of reliability theory. We explore four redundancy strategies, combining shared vs. dedicated and active vs. standby modes, and propose a general framework to minimize latency and cost while meeting reliability and deadline constraints. The problem is formulated as an Integer Non-Linear Program (INLP), and two genetic algorithm (GA)-based solutions are developed.

With 3D parallelism (tensor, pipeline, data), checkpointing involves many processes, each managing numerous tensors of varying shapes and sizes, that must be persisted frequently to stable storage (e.g., parallel file systems). This turns checkpoint/restore into a big-data I/O problem characterized by volume, variety, and velocity. The workflow must traverse the full storage stack -- from GPU memory through host memory and local storage to external repositories -- whose tiers differ by orders of magnitude in performance, creating bottlenecks under concurrency even with asynchronous flush/prefetch. Kernel-accelerated I/O libraries such as \\texttt{liburing} may mitigate these issues versus POSIX, but their effectiveness for LLM checkpointing remains underexplored. We develop microbenchmarks to quantify trade-offs when using \\texttt{liburing}, evaluating how aggregation, alignment, and I/O coalescing interact under buffered and direct I/O. We find that uncoalesced small-buffer operations halve throughput relative to synthetic workloads, while file system-aware aggregation restores bandwidth and reduces metadata overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM checkpointing engines, our approach achieves up to $3.9\\times$ higher write throughput than DataStates-LLM and $7.6\\times$ higher than TorchSnapshot.

Over the last decades, machine learning and deep learning models have reported increasing performance across software versions. However, since most files persist across releases and retain their defect labels, standard evaluation rewards label-persistence bias rather than reasoning about code changes. To address this issue, we reformulate SDP as a change-aware prediction task, in which models reason over code changes of a file within successive project versions, rather than relying on static file snapshots. Building on this formulation, we propose an LLM-driven, change-aware, multi-agent debate framework. Our experiments on multiple PROMISE projects show that traditional models achieve inflated F1, while failing on rare but critical defect-transition cases. In contrast, our change-aware reasoning and multi-agent debate framework yields more balanced performance across evolution subsets and significantly improves sensitivity to defect introductions. These results highlight fundamental flaws in current SDP evaluation practices and emphasize the need for change-aware reasoning in practical defect prediction.

Limited cache capacity of routers warrants that the choice of content being cached is judiciously done. Existing techniques resort to caching popular content to maximize utilization. However, these methods experience significant overhead for coordinating and estimating the popularity of content. To address this issue, in this paper, we present CPePC, which is a cooperative caching technique designed to improve performance. It accomplishes this through a combination of two factors. First, CPePC enhances efficiency by minimizing the overhead of popularity estimation. Second, it forecasts a parameter that governs caching decisions. Efficiency in popularity estimation is achieved by dividing the network into several non-overlapping communities using a community estimation algorithm and selecting a leader node to coordinate this on behalf of all the nodes in the community. CPePC bases its caching decisions by predicting a parameter whose value is estimated using current cache occupancy and the popularity of the content into account. We present algorithms for community detection, leader selection, content popularity estimation, and caching decisions made by the CPePC method. We evaluate and compare it with six other state-of-the-art caching techniques, with simulations performed using a discrete event simulator to show that it outperforms others."}

Thus, we present the first resource-adaptive distributed bilevel optimization framework with a second-order free hypergradient estimator, which allows each client to optimize the submodels adapted to the available resources. Due to the coupled influence of partial outer parameters x and inner parameters y, it's challenging to theoretically analyze the upper bound regarding the globally averaged hypergradient for full model parameters. The error bound of inner parameter also needs to be reformulated since the local partial training. The provable theorems show that both RABO and RAFBO can achieve an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{C_x^{\\ast}Q})$, which is dominated by the minimum coverage of the outer parameter $C_x^{\\ast}$.

This paper addresses this gap by investigating how LLM coding tools are used in professional practice, the associated concerns and risks, and the resulting transformations in development workflows, with particular attention to implications for computing education. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 57 curated YouTube videos published between late 2024 and 2025, capturing reflections and experiences shared by practitioners. Following a filtering and quality assessment process, the selected sources were analyzed to compare LLM-based and traditional programming, identify emerging risks, and characterize evolving workflows. Our findings reveal definitions of AI-based coding practices, notable productivity gains, and lowered barriers to entry. Practitioners also report a shift in development bottlenecks toward code review and concerns regarding code quality, maintainability, security vulnerabilities, ethical issues, erosion of foundational problem-solving skills, and insufficient preparation of entry-level engineers. Building on these insights, we discuss implications for computer science and software engineering education and argue for curricular shifts toward problem-solving, architectural thinking, code review, and early project-based learning that integrates LLM tools. This study offers an industry-grounded perspective on AI-based coding and provides guidance for aligning educational practices with rapidly evolving professional realities."}

However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task. This comprehensive framework motivates semantic communication designs with tunable, end-to-end privacy against adaptive adversaries in realistic wireless settings."}

This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives.

Conventional intent-based networking (IBN) methods depend on statistical language models to interpret user intent but cannot guarantee the feasibility of generated configurations. To overcome this, we develop a two-stage framework consisting of an Interpreter, which extracts intent from natural language prompts using NLP, and an Optimizer, which computes feasible virtual machine (VM) placement and routing via an integer linear programming. In particular, the Interpreter translates user chats into update directions, i.e., whether to increase, decrease, or maintain parameters such as CPU demand and latency bounds, thereby enabling iterative refinement of the network configuration. In this paper, two intent extractors, which are a Sentence-BERT model with support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and a large language model (LLM), are introduced. Experiments in single-user and multi-user settings show that the framework dynamically updates VM placement and routing while preserving feasibility. The LLM-based extractor achieves higher accuracy with fewer labeled samples, whereas the Sentence-BERT with SVM classifiers provides significantly lower latency suitable for real-time operation. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining NLP-driven intent extraction with optimization-based allocation for safe, interpretable, and user-friendly virtual network management."}

Although recent studies have adopted several methods to detect code hallucination, most of these approaches remain limited to coarse-grained detection and lack specialized techniques for fine-grained hallucination localization. This study introduces a novel method, called CoHalLo, which achieves line-level code hallucination localization by probing the hidden-layer vectors from hallucination detection models. CoHalLo uncovers the key syntactic information driving the model's hallucination judgments and locates the hallucinating code lines accordingly. Specifically, we first fine-tune the hallucination detection model on manually annotated datasets to ensure that it learns features pertinent to code syntactic information. Subsequently, we designed a probe network that projects high-dimensional latent vectors onto a low-dimensional syntactic subspace, generating vector tuples and reconstructing the predicted abstract syntax tree (P-AST). By comparing P-AST with the original abstract syntax tree (O-AST) extracted from the input AI-generated code, we identify the key syntactic structures associated with hallucinations. This information is then used to pinpoint hallucinated code lines. To evaluate CoHalLo's performance, we manually collected a dataset of code hallucinations. The experimental results show that CoHalLo achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 0.4253, Top-3 accuracy of 0.6149, Top-5 accuracy of 0.7356, Top-10 accuracy of 0.8333, IFA of 5.73, Recall@1% Effort of 0.052721, and Effort@20% Recall of 0.155269, which outperforms the baseline methods."}

Based on this architecture, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to minimize the task completion delay and energy consumption by jointly optimizing task offloading, UAV trajectory control, IRS phase-shift configuration, and computation resource allocation. The considered problem is NP-hard, and thus we propose a hierarchical online optimization approach (HOOA) to efficiently solve the problem.

However, unlike their homogeneous-ISA counterparts, explicit software support for bridging ISA heterogeneity is required. The lack of a compilation toolchain ready to support heterogeneous-ISA targets has been a major factor hindering research in this exciting emerging area. For any such compiler, \"getting right\" the mechanics involved in state transformation upon migration and doing this efficiently is of critical importance. In particular, any runtime conversion of the current program stack from one architecture to another would be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we design and develop Unifico, a new multi-ISA compiler that generates binaries that maintain the same stack layout during their execution on either architecture. Unifico avoids the need for runtime stack transformation, thus eliminating overheads associated with ISA migration. Additional responsibilities of the Unifico compiler backend include maintenance of a uniform ABI and virtual address space across ISAs. Unifico is implemented using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, and we are currently targeting the x86-64 and ARMv8 ISAs. We have evaluated Unifico across a range of compute-intensive NAS benchmarks and show its minimal impact on overall execution time, where less than 6% (10%) overhead is introduced on average for high-end (low-end) processors. We also analyze the performance impact of Unifico's key design features and demonstrate that they can be further optimized to mitigate this impact.

Still, it faces fundamental performance degradation when the distance between user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS) is large or in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. To this end, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) Rel-18 proposes to standardize sidelink (SL) positioning, which provides unique opportunities to extend the positioning coverage via direct positioning signaling between UEs. Despite the standardization advancements, the capability of SL positioning is controversial, especially how much spectrum is required to achieve the positioning accuracy defined in 3GPP. To this end, this article summarizes the latest standardization advancements of 3GPP on SL positioning comprehensively, covering a) network architecture; b) positioning types; and c) performance requirements. The capability of SL positioning using various positioning methods under different imperfect factors is evaluated and discussed in-depth. Finally, according to the evolution of SL in 3GPP Rel-19, we discuss the possible research directions and challenges of SL positioning."}

However, LLMs can generate output that deviates from what the user wants, requiring supervision and editing. To support this process, we offer techniques to localize where generations might be misaligned from user intent. We first create a dataset of \"Minimal Intent Aligning Patches\" of repaired LLM generated programs. Each program uses test cases to verify correctness. After creating a dataset of programs, we measure how well various techniques can assign a well-calibrated probability to indicate which parts of code will be edited in a minimal patch (i.e., give a probability that corresponds with empirical odds it is edited). We compare white-box probing (where we propose a technique for efficient arbitrary-span querying), against black-box reflective and self-consistency based approaches. We find probes with a small supervisor model can achieve low calibration error and Brier Skill Score of approx 0.2 estimating edited lines on code generated by models many orders of magnitude larger. We discuss the generalizability of the techniques, and the connections to AI oversight and control, finding a probe trained only on code shows some signs of generalizing to natural language errors if new probability scaling is allowed."}

We present R$^2$CCL, a fault-tolerant communication library that provides lossless, low-overhead failover by exploiting multi-NIC hardware. R$^2$CCL performs rapid connection migration, bandwidth-aware load redistribution, and resilient collective algorithms to maintain progress under failures. We evaluate R$^2$CCL on two 8-GPU H100 InfiniBand servers and via large-scale ML simulators modeling hundreds of GPUs with diverse failure patterns.

To further improve data quality, numerous training data optimization techniques have been proposed; however, their overall effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study, examining five widely-used training data optimization techniques and their pairwise combinations for LLM-based code generation across three benchmarks and four LLMs. Our results show that data synthesis is the most effective technique for improving functional correctness and reducing code smells, although it performs relatively worse on code maintainability compared to data refactoring, cleaning, and selection. Regarding combinations, we find that most combinations do not further improve functional correctness but can effectively enhance code quality (code smells and maintainability). Among all combinations, data synthesis combined with data refactoring achieves the strongest overall performance. Furthermore, our fine-grained analysis reinforces these findings and provides deeper insights into how individual techniques and their combinations influence code generation effectiveness. Overall, this work represents a first step toward a systematic understanding of training data optimization and combination strategies, offering practical guidance for future research and deployment in LLM-based code generation."}

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort."}

A BERTopic-Based Analysis of Pull Requests", "comment": null, "summary": "LLM-based software engineering is influencing modern software development. In addition to correctness, prior studies have also examined the performance of software artifacts generated by AI agents. However, it is unclear how exactly the agentic AI systems address performance concerns in practice. In this paper, we present an empirical study of performance-related pull requests generated by AI agents. Using LLM-assisted detection and BERTopic-based topic modeling, we identified 52 performance-related topics grouped into 10 higher-level categories. Our results show that AI agents apply performance optimizations across diverse layers of the software stack and that the type of optimization significantly affects pull request acceptance rates and review times. We also found that performance optimization by AI agents primarily occurs during the development phase, with less focus on the maintenance phase. Our findings provide empirical evidence that can support the evaluation and improvement of agentic AI systems with respect to their performance optimization behaviors and review outcomes."}

Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair.\n  To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs."}

A Pull Request-Based Study", "comment": null, "summary": "As Software Engineering enters its new era (SE 3.0), AI coding agents increasingly automate software development workflows. However, it remains unclear how exactly these agents recognize and address software energy concerns-an issue growing in importance due to large-scale data centers, energy-hungry language models, and battery-constrained devices. In this paper, we examined the energy awareness of agent-authored pull requests (PRs) using a publicly available dataset. We identified 216 energy-explicit PRs and conducted a thematic analysis, deriving a taxonomy of energy-aware work. Our further analysis of the applied optimization techniques shows that most align with established research recommendations. Although building and running these agents is highly energy intensive, encouragingly, the results indicate that they exhibit energy awareness when generating software artifacts. However, optimization-related PRs are accepted less frequently than others, largely due to their negative impact on maintainability."}

This study presents the first ecosystem-scale longitudinal analysis of software defects across 123 open source quantum repositories from 2012 to 2024, spanning eight functional categories, including full-stack libraries, simulators, annealing, algorithms, compilers, assembly, cryptography, and experimental computing. Using a mixed method approach combining repository mining, static code analysis, issue metadata extraction, and a validated rule-based classification framework, we analyze 32,296 verified bug reports. Results show that full-stack libraries and compilers are the most defect-prone categories due to circuit, gate, and transpilation-related issues, while simulators are mainly affected by measurement and noise modeling errors. Classical bugs primarily impact usability and interoperability, whereas quantum-specific bugs disproportionately degrade performance, maintainability, and reliability. Longitudinal analysis indicates ecosystem maturation, with defect densities peaking between 2017 and 2021 and declining thereafter. High-severity defects cluster in cryptography, experimental computing, and compiler toolchains. Repositories employing automated testing detect more defects and resolve issues faster. A negative binomial regression further shows that automated testing is associated with an approximate 60 percent reduction in expected defect incidence. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale data-driven characterization of quantum software defects and offers empirical guidance for improving testing, documentation, and maintainability practices in QSE."}

Suppressing the noise interference in existing works does not manage the tough job, i.e., eliminating the noise in the targets. In this paper, we propose MATUS to mitigate the target noise for precise bug detection based on similarity measurement. Feature slices are extracted from both the buggy query and the targets to represent the semantic feature of (potential) bug logics. In particular, MATUS guides the target slicing with the prior knowledge from the buggy code, in an end-to-end way to pinpoint the slicing criterion in the targets. All feature slices are embedded and compared based on the vector similarity. Buggy candidates are audited to confirm unknown bugs in the targets. Experiments show that MATUS holds advantages in bug detection for real-world projects with acceptable efficiency. In total, MATUS has spotted 31 unknown bugs in the Linux kernel. All of them have been confirmed by the kernel developers, and 11 have been assigned CVEs."}

In peak periods such as holidays, it is often faced with the challenge of high concurrency scenarios because of a large number of users accessing at the same time. The traditional aggregation architecture can not meet the peak user requirements because of its insufficient fault tolerance and low ability. Therefore, the system needs to use microservice architecture for development, and add multiple security methods to ensure that the system can have good stability and data consistency under high concurrency scenarios, and can respond quickly to user requests. This paper introduces the use of B/S architecture and Spring Cloud to design and develop a railway ticket purchase system that can maintain stability and reliability under high concurrency scenarios, and formulate multiple security design methods for the system. This system integrates a range of functions, such as real-time train inquiries, dynamic seat updates, online seat selection, and ticket purchasing, effectively addressing common problems associated with offline ticket purchasing, such as long queues and delayed information. It enables a complete online process from inquiry and booking to payment and refunds. Furthermore, the \"add passenger\" function allows users to purchase tickets for others, extending the convenience of online ticketing to people with limited internet access. The system design prioritizes security and stability, while also focusing on high performance, and achieves these goals through a carefully designed architecture and the integration of multiple middleware components. After the completion of the system development, the core interface of the system is tested, and then the results are analyzed. The test data proves that the system has good ability and stability under high concurrency."}
