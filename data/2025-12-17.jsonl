These workloads generate highly irregular and bursty access patterns, causing traditional prefetching and replacement policies to mispredict and trigger severe cache pollution, thereby degrading system performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Adaptive Cache Pollution Control (ACPC) mechanism tailored for LLM inference workloads, integrating Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-based access prediction with a priority-aware replacement strategy. The TCN module learns temporal dependencies in token access sequences to identify potential high-reuse cache lines, while the replacement policy dynamically adjusts eviction priorities based on predicted reuse likelihood and cache occupancy. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated on representative transformer-based inference traces, including GPT-style autoregressive decoding and embedding retrieval workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPC reduces cache pollution by 41.7 percent, improves cache hit rate by 8.9 percent, and achieves a 60.0 percent reduction in L2 miss penalty, compared with state-of-the-art machine-learning-based replacement baselines. Additionally, the proposed Temporal CNN-based ACPC framework increases token generation throughput by 15.9 percent and achieves the lowest final loss of 0.21, confirming its superior efficiency and stability under complex LLM inference workloads. These results highlight ACPC's effectiveness in recognizing useful cache lines and mitigating redundant prefetches under dynamic LLM access behaviors. The proposed approach provides a scalable, learning-driven solution for optimizing memory efficiency and latency in large-scale LLM serving and inference systems."}

In this work, we point out three inherent limitations of ML-based power models: unreliability, limited interpretability, and difficulty in usage. This work proposes a new analytical power modeling framework named ReadyPower, which is ready-for-use by being reliable, interpretable, and handy. We observe that the root cause of the low accuracy of classical analytical power models is the discrepancies between the real processor implementation and the processor's analytical model. To bridge the discrepancies, we introduce architecture-level, implementation-level, and technology-level parameters into the widely adopted McPAT analytical model to build ReadyPower. The parameters at three different levels are decided in different ways.

Nevertheless, providing high-speed internet access in these regions is essential to promote digital inclusion. 5G Fixed Wireless Access (5G FWA) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, its one-hop topology limits coverage. To overcome this limitation, a multi-hop architecture is required. This work proposes a unified multi-hop framework that integrates long-haul microwave, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), and FWA to provide wide coverage and high capacity in rural areas. As the number of hops increases, total energy consumption also rises, a challenge often overlooked in existing literature.

When the network is underutilized, the proposed approach dynamically operates at reduced capacity to minimize energy consumption. We optimize the off, start-up, serving, deep sleep, and wake-up sates of microwave radios to balance energy use and satisfying data rate requirements. Additionally, we optimize resource block allocation for IAB-based FWA nodes connected to microwave backhaul.

This has led to a growing focus on fairness in AI software recently, alongside the traditional focus on the effectiveness of AI models. Through 26 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from different application domains and with varied backgrounds across 23 countries, we conducted research on fairness requirements in AI from software engineering perspective. Our study assesses the participants' awareness of fairness in AI / ML software and its application within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from translating fairness concerns into requirements to assessing their arising early in the SDLC. It also examines fairness through the key assessment dimensions of implementation, validation, evaluation, and how it is balanced with trade-offs involving other priorities, such as addressing all the software functionalities and meeting critical delivery deadlines. Findings of our thematic qualitative analysis show that while our participants recognize the aforementioned AI fairness dimensions, practices are inconsistent, and fairness is often deprioritized with noticeable knowledge gaps. This highlights the need for agreement with relevant stakeholders on well-defined, contextually appropriate fairness definitions, the corresponding evaluation metrics, and formalized processes to better integrate fairness into AI/ML projects."}

However, their growing scale and video-level inputs lead to significant computational and memory overhead, posing challenges for real-time deployment on hardware accelerators. While prior work attempts to reduce redundancy via token pruning or merging, these methods typically operate at coarse granularity and incur high runtime overhead due to global token-level operations. In this study, we propose Focus, a Streaming Concentration Architecture that efficiently accelerates VLM inference through progressive, fine-grained redundancy elimination. Focus introduces a multilevel concentration paradigm that hierarchically compresses vision-language inputs at three levels: (1) semantic-guided token pruning based on textual prompts, (2) spatial-temporal block-level concentration using localized comparisons, and (3) vector-level redundancy removal via motion-aware matching. All concentration steps are tightly co-designed with the architecture to support streaming-friendly, on-chip execution. Focus leverages GEMM tiling, convolution-style layout, and cross-modal attention to minimize off-chip access while enabling high throughput. Implemented as a modular unit within a systolic-array accelerator, Focus achieves a 2.4x speedup and 3.3x reduction in energy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art accelerators in both performance and energy efficiency.

This decentralization is achieved through the implementation of microservice architectures, which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA) such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure SLA compliance. This is achieved by sophisticated orchestration strategies such as Kubernetes, which help facilitate resource management. The orchestration strategies alone do not guarantee SLA adherence due to the inherent delay of scaling resources. Existing auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to address these challenges, but they suffer from performance issues and configuration complexity. In this paper, a novel auto-scaling algorithm is proposed for SLA-constrained edge computing applications. This approach combines a Machine Learning (ML) based proactive auto-scaling algorithm, capable of predicting incoming resource requests to forecast demand, with a reactive autoscaler which considers current resource utilization and SLA constraints for immediate adjustments. The algorithm is integrated into Kubernetes as an extension, and its performance is evaluated through extensive experiments in an edge environment with real applications. The results demonstrate that existing solutions have an SLA violation rate of up to 23%, whereas the proposed hybrid solution outperforms the baselines with an SLA violation rate of only 6%, ensuring stable SLA compliance across various applications."}

Because these services directly influence public trust, any disruption can have significant societal and political consequences. Yet their supporting infrastructures remain vulnerable to outages from natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, and targeted attacks.

While indispensable, this infrastructure also represents a potential and critical point of system failure. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive assessment framework with purpose-designed mechanisms to systematically evaluate the operational resilience of authoritative DNS infrastructure supporting government services. Complementing prior studies on website hosting, recursive resolution, and DNS record integrity, our work provides a holistic view of authoritative DNS operation. Our first contribution develops a multi-sourced data schema that characterizes a (government) domain's authoritative DNS infrastructure across four hierarchical levels: physical hosting infrastructure, server functionality, name servers, and individual hosting instances. Using data collected from six representative countries, our second contribution identifies resilience attributes at their finest applicable hierarchy across three operational phases: infrastructure placement, service configuration, and DNS record dispatch. Our method assigns numerical scores to each attribute and aggregates them algorithmically to enable consistent and cross-domain comparisons. We apply our method to government domains in the six countries, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in authoritative DNS resilience and pinpointing operational practices that require improvement."}

This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models. Unlike prior work that emphasizes multi-turn reasoning, VGCO focuses on the single-turn, large-scale tool-calling problem and achieves significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across LLMs."}

These barriers necessarily result in idle periods on some of the workers, which reduces their stability and performance, compared to equivalent workloads with no barriers.\n  In this paper we will consider and analyze the stability and performance penalties resulting from barriers. We include an analysis of the stability of $(s,k,l)$ barrier systems that allow jobs to depart after $l$ out of $k$ of their tasks complete. We also derive and evaluate performance bounds for hybrid barrier systems servicing a mix of jobs, both with and without barriers, and with varying degrees of parallelism.

This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context.\n  We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness. Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations. Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content.

The promise of agents is that developers might write code quicker, delegate multiple tasks to different agents, and even write a full piece of software purely out of natural language. In reality, what roles agents play in professional software development remains in question. This paper investigates how experienced developers use agents in building software, including their motivations, strategies, task suitability, and sentiments. Through field observations (N=13) and qualitative surveys (N=99), we find that while experienced developers value agents as a productivity boost, they retain their agency in software design and implementation out of insistence on fundamental software quality attributes, employing strategies for controlling agent behavior leveraging their expertise. In addition, experienced developers feel overall positive about incorporating agents into software development given their confidence in complementing the agents' limitations. Our results shed light on the value of software development best practices in effective use of agents, suggest the kinds of tasks for which agents may be suitable, and point towards future opportunities for better agentic interfaces and agentic use guidelines."}

We consider hybrid players where the computing capacity of edge servers (ESs) are augmented by vehicular-UAV agent pairs (AgPs) that can be proactively dispatched to overloaded hotspots. Unique key challenges should be addressed: highly uncertain spatio-temporal workloads, spatio-temporal coupling between road traffic and UAV capacity, forecast-driven contracting risks, and heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of human users (HuUs) and machine users (MaUs). To cope with these issues, we propose FUSION, a two-stage framework that tightly couples service demand prediction, agent deployment, and task scheduling. In the offline stage, a Pro-LNN module performs intelligent multi-step spatio-temporal demand forecasting at distributed ESs, whose outputs are exploited by an enhanced ant colony optimization-based routing scheme (eACO-VRP) and an auction-based incentive-compatible contracting mechanism (Off-AIC^2), to jointly determine ES-AgP contracts and pre-planned service routes. In the online stage, we formulate congestion-aware task scheduling as an potential game among HuUs, MaUs, and heterogeneous ES/UAV providers, and devise a potential-guided best-response dynamics (PG-BR) algorithm that provably converges to a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world traces show that FUSION significantly improves social welfare, latency, resource utilization, and robustness compared with state-of-the-art baselines."}

We argue that current LLMs struggle not only due to data scarcity but, more importantly, because they lack supervision that guides interpretable and effective performance improvements. In this work, we introduce PerfCoder, a family of LLMs specifically designed to generate performance-enhanced code from source code via interpretable, customized optimizations. PerfCoder is fine-tuned on a curated collection of real-world optimization trajectories with human-readable annotations, and preference-aligned by reinforcement fine-tuning using runtime measurements, enabling it to propose input-specific improvement strategies and apply them directly without relying on iterative refinement. On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes. Specifically, we elevate the performance of 32B models and GPT-5 to new levels on code optimization, substantially surpassing their original performance."}

In other situations the parallel tasks have constraints that require them to synchronize their start and possibly departure times. This is true of many parallelized machine learning workloads, and the popular Apache Spark processing engine has recently added support for Barrier Execution Mode, which allows users to add such barriers to their jobs. These barriers necessarily result in idle periods on some of the workers, which reduces their stability and performance, compared to equivalent workloads with no barriers.\n  In this paper we will consider and analyze the stability and performance penalties resulting from barriers. We include an analysis of the stability of $(s,k,l)$ barrier systems that allow jobs to depart after $l$ out of $k$ of their tasks complete. We also derive and evaluate performance bounds for hybrid barrier systems servicing a mix of jobs, both with and without barriers, and with varying degrees of parallelism. For the purely 1-barrier case we compare the bounds and simulation results to benchmark data from a standalone Spark system. We study the overhead in the real system, and based on its distribution we attribute it to the dual event and polling-driven mechanism used to schedule barrier-mode jobs. We develop a model for this type of overhead and validate it against the real system through simulation."}

Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for automation, existing applications rely on simplistic prompting without task decomposition or domain adaptation, resulting in unreliable black-box behavior and limited insight into model capabilities across penetration testing stages. To address this gap, we introduce PentestEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across six decomposed penetration testing stages: Information Collection, Weakness Gathering and Filtering, Attack Decision-Making, Exploit Generation and Revision. PentestEval integrates expert-annotated ground truth with a fully automated evaluation pipeline across 346 tasks covering all stages in 12 realistic vulnerable scenarios. Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely. These findings highlight that autonomous penetration testing demands stronger structured reasoning, where modularization enhances each individual stage and improves overall performance. PentestEval provides the foundational benchmark needed for future research on fine-grained, stage-level evaluation, paving the way toward more reliable LLM-based automation."}

This, in turn, introduces challenges in relation to security standard compliance traditionally following a more linear workflow. This is especially a challenge for the engineering of products and services associated with critical infrastructures. To support companies in their transition towards DevOps, this paper presents an adaptation of DevOps according to security regulations and standards. We report on our longitudinal study at Siemens AG, consisting of several individual sub-studies in the inception, validation, and initial adoption of our framework based on RefA as well as the implications for practice. RefA is a prescriptive model of a security compliant DevOps lifecycle based on the IEC 62443-4-1 standard. The overall framework is aimed at professionals, not only security experts, being able to use it on implementing DevOps processes while remaining compliant with security norms. We demonstrate how RefA facilitates the transfer of security compliance knowledge to product development teams. This knowledge transfer supports the agility aim of ensuring that cross-functional teams have all the skills needed to deliver the compliant products."}

Property-based testing addresses this shortcoming by generating multiple inputs satisfying properties but requires significant manual effort to define properties and their constraints. We propose a semantics-based approach that automatically transforms unit tests into property-based tests by extracting specifications from implementations via single-path symbolic analysis. We demonstrate this approach through Teralizer, a prototype for Java that transforms JUnit tests into property-based jqwik tests. Unlike prior work that generalizes from input-output examples, Teralizer derives specifications from program semantics.\n  We evaluated Teralizer on three progressively challenging datasets. On EvoSuite-generated tests for EqBench and Apache Commons utilities, Teralizer improved mutation scores by 1-4 percentage points. Generalization of mature developer-written tests from Apache Commons utilities showed only 0.05-0.07 percentage points improvement. Analysis of 632 real-world Java projects from RepoReapers highlights applicability barriers: only 1.7% of projects completed the generalization pipeline, with failures primarily due to type support limitations in symbolic analysis and static analysis limitations in our prototype. Based on the results, we provide a roadmap for future work, identifying research and engineering challenges that need to be tackled to advance the field of test generalization.\n  Artifacts available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17950381"}

However, developing cloud-of-things (CoT) applications remains challenging. It requires significant technical expertise and lacks standardized, model-driven methodologies. Current approaches fail to ensure interoperability, automation, and efficiency. This study introduces the Model of Things (MoT), a model-based approach that incorporates low-code principles to simplify CoT development. MoT reduces technical barriers by providing a custom UML profile designed for IoT and cloud services. To evaluate MoT, we conducted a case study and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The results confirmed MoT's feasibility, demonstrating that it streamlines CoT application development and deployment. Users found MoT accessible, even with limited IoT experience, and reported high perceived ease of use and usefulness. Qualitative feedback highlighted MoT's ability to reduce complexity and speed up development. MoT offers a promising, model-driven solution for CoT application development. By lowering entry barriers and promoting automation, it enhances both efficiency and flexibility. This study represents a step toward a more user-friendly framework, enabling broader adoption of CoT technologies."}

As these systems scale, sustainability concerns have intensified, with most assessments focusing on model architecture, hardware efficiency, and deployment infrastructure. However, existing mitigation efforts largely overlook how user interaction practices themselves shape the energy profile of LLM based systems. In this vision paper, we argue that interaction level behavior appears to be an underexamined factor shaping the environmental impact of LLM based systems, and we present this issue across four dimensions. First, extended conversational patterns increase token production and raise the computational cost of inference. Second, expectations of instant responses limit opportunities for energy aware scheduling and workload consolidation. Third, everyday user habits contribute to cumulative operational demand in ways that are rarely quantified. Fourth, the accumulation of context affects memory requirements and reduces the efficiency of long running dialogues. Addressing these challenges requires rethinking how chatbot interactions are designed and conceptualized, and adopting perspectives that recognize sustainability as partly dependent on the conversational norms through which users engage with LLM based systems."}
