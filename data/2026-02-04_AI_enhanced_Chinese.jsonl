To mitigate this, recent methods assemble pre-calculated KV caches of retrieved RAG documents (by a user query) and reprocess selected tokens to recover cross-attention between these pre-calculated KV caches. However, we identify a fundamental \"crowding-out effect\" in current token selection criteria: globally salient but user-query-irrelevant tokens saturate the limited recomputation budget, displacing the tokens truly essential for answering the user query and degrading inference accuracy.\n  We propose ProphetKV, a user-query-driven KV Cache reuse method for RAG scenarios. ProphetKV dynamically prioritizes tokens based on their semantic relevance to the user query and employs a dual-stage recomputation pipeline to fuse layer-wise attention metrics into a high-utility set. By ensuring the recomputation budget is dedicated to bridging the informational gap between retrieved context and the user query, ProphetKV achieves high-fidelity attention recovery with minimal overhead. Our extensive evaluation results show that ProphetKV retains 96%-101% of full-prefill accuracy with only a 20% recomputation ratio, while achieving accuracy improvements of 8.8%-24.9% on RULER and 18.6%-50.9% on LongBench over the state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., CacheBlend, EPIC, and KVShare).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

First, we introduce \\emph{Prefix Consensus}, where parties input vectors and output $(v^{\\sf low},v^{\\sf high})$ that (i) extend the maximum common prefix of honest inputs and (ii) satisfy $v_i^{\\sf low}\\preceq v_j^{\\sf high}$ for all honest $i,j$. Unlike classical consensus, no single output is required. We show Prefix Consensus is solvable asynchronously and give tight round-complexity bounds.\n  We then define \\emph{Strong Prefix Consensus}, requiring agreement on the \\emph{high} output. Our protocol is leaderless and partially synchronous: one Prefix Consensus instance decides (possibly different) lows, and additional instances yield a unique safe-to-extend high, even if an adversary can suspend one party per round.\n  We lift this to a leaderless, multi-proposer, censorship-resistant BFT SMR protocol: per slot, all parties broadcast proposals, deterministically rank them, and run one Strong Prefix Consensus on proposal hashes, committing honest proposals in \\emph{four rounds}. A deterministic demotion rule updates the ranking when a party's proposal is excluded, implying that after GST at most $f$ slots can miss an honest proposal while progress remains leaderless under suspension and up to $f{-}1$ Byzantine faults.\n  Finally, we connect Prefix Consensus to graded and binary/validated consensus: we obtain an optimal-latency graded consensus (3 message delays) and leaderless Binary/Validated Consensus with worst-case message complexity $O(n^3)$ and communication $O(n^4)$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To tackle this issue, we propose NSC-SL, a bandwidth-aware adaptive compression algorithm for communication-efficient SL. NSC-SL first dynamically determines the optimal rank of low-rank approximation based on the singular value distribution for adapting real-time bandwidth constraints. Then, NSC-SL performs error-compensated tensor factorization using alternating orthogonal iteration with residual feedback, effectively minimizing truncation loss.

This paper introduces data-driven silicon sociology as a systematic empirical framework for studying social structure formation among interacting artificial agents. We present a pioneering large-scale data mining investigation of an in-the-wild agent society by analyzing Moltbook, a social platform designed primarily for agent-to-agent interaction. At the time of study, Moltbook hosted over 150,000 registered autonomous agents operating across thousands of agent-created sub-communities. Using programmatic and non-intrusive data acquisition, we collected and analyzed the textual descriptions of 12,758 submolts, which represent proactive sub-community partitioning activities within the ecosystem. Treating agent-authored descriptions as first-class observational artifacts, we apply rigorous preprocessing, contextual embedding, and unsupervised clustering techniques to uncover latent patterns of thematic organization and social space structuring. The results show that autonomous agents systematically organize collective space through reproducible patterns spanning human-mimetic interests, silicon-centric self-reflection, and early-stage economic and coordination behaviors. Rather than relying on predefined sociological taxonomies, these structures emerge directly from machine-generated data traces.

When these phases share GPU resources, prefill tasks throttle the processing speed of concurrent decodes, creating state-dependent contention. This contention is further complicated by workload heterogeneity, as different applications exhibit vastly different input and output lengths. We develop a stochastic control framework for scheduling heterogeneous LLM workloads across large GPU clusters. We formulate LLM inference as a multiclass many-server queueing network with state-dependent service rates, grounded in empirical iteration-time measurements. We analyze the fluid approximation of this system and solve steady-state linear programs that characterize optimal resource allocation. We design gate-and-route policies that regulate prefill admission and decode routing, and prove that they are asymptotically optimal in the many-GPU limit under both bundled and separate token-pricing schemes.

Together, these contributions demonstrate how AI can enhance network performance, reduce operational overhead, and expand access to advanced digital services, aligning with broader goals of sustainable and inclusive network development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u6258\u7ba1\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u670d\u52a1\u8986\u76d6", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9759\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u56de\u4f20\u94fe\u8def\u8584\u5f31\u793e\u533a\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97AI\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u9650\u5236", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408AI\u8f85\u52a9\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u9065\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ad9\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u8fb9\u7f18\u6258\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b", "result": "AI\u65b9\u6848\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u7ef4\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u670d\u52a1\u53ef\u53ca\u6027", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u666e\u60e0\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8d21\u732e"}}

However, while smaller agents can closely match larger ones on simple tasks, it remains unclear how their performance scales with task complexity, when large models become necessary, and how to better leverage small agents for long-horizon workloads. In this work, we empirically show that small agents' performance fails to scale with task complexity on deep search and coding tasks, and we introduce Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency (SALE), an agent framework inspired by freelancer marketplaces. In SALE, agents bid with short strategic plans, which are scored by a systematic cost-value mechanism and refined via a shared auction memory, enabling per-task routing and continual self-improvement without training a separate router or running all models to completion. Across deep search and coding tasks of varying complexity, SALE reduces reliance on the largest agent by 53%, lowers overall cost by 35%, and consistently improves upon the largest agent's pass@1 with only a negligible overhead beyond executing the final trace. In contrast, established routers that rely on task descriptions either underperform the largest agent or fail to reduce cost -- often both -- underscoring their poor fit for agentic workflows. These results suggest that while small agents may be insufficient for complex workloads, they can be effectively \"scaled up\" through coordinated task allocation and test-time self-improvement. More broadly, they motivate a systems-level view of agentic AI in which performance gains come less from ever-larger individual models and more from market-inspired coordination mechanisms that organize heterogeneous agents into efficient, adaptive ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSALE\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u62cd\u5356\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5c0f\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u7531\u5668\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aagent\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SALE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u81ea\u7531\u804c\u4e1a\u8005\u5e02\u573a\uff1a\u4ee3\u7406\u7ade\u6807\u7b80\u77ed\u6218\u7565\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u672c am\u00e9ric\u503c\u673a\u5236\u6253\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u5171\u4eab\u62cd\u5356\u5185\u5b58\u96c6\u6210\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u8def\u7531\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u989d\u5916\u8def\u7531\u5668\u6216\u9700\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8fd0\u884c\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cSALE\u51cf\u5c1153%\u5bf9\u5927\u4ee3\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u964d\u4f4e35% zelfs\u5168\u7403\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684pass@1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ee5\u5e02\u573a\u673a\u5236\u534f\u8c03\u5f02\u6784\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7AI\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6e90\u81ea\u667a\u80fd\u534f\u8c03\u800c\u975e\u4e00\u5473\u6269\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002"}}

Manual alert triage, which typically involves log inspection, API verification, and cross-referencing operational knowledge bases, remains a major bottleneck in reducing mean recovery time (MTTR). This paper presents an agentic observability framework deployed within Adobe's e-commerce infrastructure that autonomously performs alert triage using a ReAct paradigm. Upon alert detection, the agent dynamically identifies the affected service, retrieves and analyzes correlated logs across distributed systems, and plans context-dependent actions such as handbook consultation, runbook execution, or retrieval-augmented analysis of recently deployed code. Empirical results from production deployment indicate a 90% reduction in mean time to insight compared to manual triage, while maintaining comparable diagnostic accuracy.

However, existing studies often rely on limited datasets and fixed network configurations. In this paper, we analyze Zigbee network traffic from three complementary perspectives: data collection, traffic classification, and storage efficiency. We introduce ZIOTP2025, a publicly available dataset of Zigbee traffic collected from commercial smart home devices deployed under multiple network configurations and capturing realistic interaction scenarios. Using this dataset, we study two traffic classification tasks: device type classification and individual device identification, and evaluate their robustness under both intra-configuration and cross-configuration settings. Our results show that while high classification accuracy can be achieved under controlled conditions, performance degrades significantly when models are evaluated across different network configurations, particularly for fine-grained identification tasks. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between traffic storage requirements and classification accuracy. We show that lossy compression of traffic features through quantization can reduce storage requirements by approximately 4-5x compared to lossless storage of raw packet traces, while preserving near-lossless classification performance.

The dominant approach, Multi-Agent Path Finding, relies on centralized control and synchronous collision avoidance, which often requires strict synchronization and guarantees of globally conflict-free execution. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing Cost model on mixed graphs, a novel framework tailored to asynchronous settings. In our model, instead of treating conflicts as hard constraints, each agent is assigned a path, and the system is evaluated through a cost function that measures potential head-on encounters. This ``crossing cost'', which is defined as the product of the numbers of agents traversing an edge in opposite directions, quantifies the risk of congestion and delay in decentralized execution.\n  Our contributions are both game-theoretic and algorithmic. We model the setting as a congestion game with a non-standard cost function, prove the existence of pure Nash equilibria, and analyze the dynamics leading to them. Equilibria can be found in polynomial time under mild conditions, while the general case is PLS-complete. From an optimization perspective, minimizing the total crossing cost is NP-hard, as the problem generalizes Steiner Orientation. To address this hardness barrier, we design a suite of parameterized algorithms for minimizing crossing cost, with parameters including the number of arcs, edges, agents, and structural graph measures. These yield XP or FPT results depending on the parameter, offering algorithmic strategies for structurally restricted instances. Our framework provides a new theoretical foundation for decentralized multi-agent routing, bridging equilibrium analysis and parameterized complexity to support scalable and risk-aware coordination.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite decades of research on system testing, many storage-system failures (including durability, ordering, recovery, and consistency violations) remain difficult to expose systematically. This difficulty stems not primarily from insufficient testing tooling, but from intrinsic properties of storage-system execution, including nondeterministic interleavings, long-horizon state evolution, and correctness semantics that span multiple layers and execution phases.\n  This survey adopts a storage-centric view of system testing and organizes existing techniques according to the execution properties and failure mechanisms they target. We review a broad spectrum of approaches, ranging from concurrency testing and long-running workloads to crash-consistency analysis, hardware-level semantic validation, and distributed fault injection, and analyze their fundamental strengths and limitations. Within this framework, we examine fuzzing as an automated testing paradigm, highlighting systematic mismatches between conventional fuzzing assumptions and storage-system semantics, and discuss how recent artificial intelligence advances may complement fuzzing through state-aware and semantic guidance.

We show that the resulting flow-weighted end-to-end delay minimization is a convex program, yielding a global system-optimal solution characterized by KKT conditions that equalize total marginal costs (a path marginal access term plus a node congestion price) across all utilized routes. This condition admits a Wardrop-type interpretation: for each source, all utilized options equalize total marginal cost, while any option with strictly larger total marginal cost receives no flow. Building on this structure, we develop a lightweight distributed pricing-based algorithm in which each service node locally computes and broadcasts a scalar congestion price from its observed aggregate load, while each source updates its traffic split by solving a small separable convex allocation problem under the advertised prices. Numerical illustrations demonstrate convergence of the distributed iteration to the centralized optimum and highlight the trade-offs induced by jointly modeling access and service congestion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u7f51\u7edc\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u8861\u8fb9\u9645\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4e2a\u6e90\u81f3\u591a\u4e2a\u670d\u52a1\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8def\u5f84\u63a5\u5165\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u901f\u7387\uff08\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u8282\u70b9\u6392\u961f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff08\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u670d\u52a1\u8282\u70b9\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u5e7f\u64ad\u62e5\u5835\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6e90\u8282\u70b9\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0b\u6c42\u89e3\u5c0f\u578b\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u51f8\u4e5f\u4f1a\u9898\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u5230\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u63a5\u5165\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6743\u8861\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6298\u73b0\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

When a team operates in an uncoordinated manner, and agents choose actions that are only individually optimal, the team's outcome can suffer. However, in many domains, coordination requires costly communication. We explore the value of coordination in a broad class of differentiable motion-planning problems. In particular, we model coordinated behavior as a spectrum: at one extreme, agents jointly optimize a common team objective, and at the other, agents make unilaterally optimal decisions given their individual decision variables, i.e., they operate at Nash equilibria.

While recent works have introduced Large Language Model (LLM) based agents for Linux kernel crash-resolution, their evaluation benchmarks are usually static and thus, do not capture the evolving nature of the Linux kernel, and suffer from potential data contamination due to LLM knowledge cutoffs. To address the above problem, we present (i) Live-kBench, an evaluation framework for self-evolving benchmarks that continuously scrapes and evaluates agents on freshly discovered kernel bugs, and (ii) kEnv, an agent-agnostic standardized crash-resolution environment for kernel compilation, execution, and feedback. This design decouples agent workflows from heavy-weight execution, enabling fair and scalable comparison across diverse agent frameworks under identical conditions.\n  To this end, we curate an inaugural dataset of 534 Linux kernel bugs and empirically demonstrate a significant performance gap, with agents achieving up to 25% higher equivalent patch rate on bugs fixed before the LLM knowledge cutoff. Using kEnv, we benchmark three state-of-the-art agents, showing that they resolve 74% of crashes on the first attempt (plausible patches); however only ~20% of generated patches closely match developer fixes.

QUIC's encryption and connection migration features obscure flow semantics, disrupting middlebox visibility and functionality. We examine how QUIC disrupts middleboxes like Network Address Translators (NATs), Rate Limiters, Load Balancers, etc., and affects Kubernetes-based service deployments.

Moreover, most MAS communicate primarily through natural language, making them vulnerable to error accumulation and instability in long-context, multi-stage interactions within internal agent histories.\n  In this work, we propose \\textbf{Agent Primitives}, a set of reusable latent building blocks for LLM-based MAS. Inspired by neural network design, where complex models are built from reusable components, we observe that many existing MAS architectures can be decomposed into a small number of recurring internal computation patterns. Based on this observation, we instantiate three primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution. All primitives communicate internally via key-value (KV) cache, which improves both robustness and efficiency by mitigating information degradation across multi-stage interactions. To enable automatic system construction, an Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations, forming a primitive-based MAS.\n  Experiments show that primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5\\% over single-agent baselines, reduce token usage and inference latency by approximately 3$\\times$-4$\\times$ compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3$\\times$-1.6$\\times$ overhead relative to single-agent inference and providing more stable performance across model backbones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAgent Primitives\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6f5c\u6784\u5efa\u5757\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MAS\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5316\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u3001\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u4e14\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u4fe1\u6613\u5728\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5f15\u53d1\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316Review\u3001Voting and Selection\u3001Planning and Execution\u4e09\u4e2a\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u8fc7KV\u7f13\u5b58\u901a\u4fe1\uff1bOrganizer\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u7ec4\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534712.0-16.5%\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6587\u672cMAS\uff0c\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e3\u00d7-4\u00d7\uff0c\u5f00\u9500\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76841.3\u00d7-1.6\u00d7\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "Agent Primitives\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347MAS\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing works mainly work towards two directions: traditional pixel-codec streaming nearly approaches its limit and is hard to step further in compression; the emerging neural-enhanced or generative streaming usually fall short in latency and visual fidelity, hindering their practical deployment. Inspired by the recent success of vision foundation model (VFM), we strive to harness the powerful video understanding and processing capacities of VFM to achieve generalization, high fidelity and loss resilience for real-time video streaming with even higher compression rate. We present the first revolutionized paradigm that enables VFM-based end-to-end generative video streaming towards this goal. Specifically, Morphe employs joint training of visual tokenizers and variable-resolution spatiotemporal optimization under simulated network constraints. Additionally, a robust streaming system is constructed that leverages intelligent packet dropping to resist real-world network perturbations.

Individuals with cognitive impairment (IwCI) often face significant challenges in learning and navigating their environment. Despite its importance, mainstream navigation technologies are rarely designed with their diverse needs in mind. This study reframes the search for places as a socially distributed task and emphasizes the role of proxy stakeholders, who act on behalf or in coordination with IwCI during navigation. Using a qualitatively led mixed-methods approach, which includes an international survey and a three-stage interview study, we examine the real-world strategies that proxy stakeholders employ to support daily navigation. The findings are synthesized into a set of empirically grounded design recommendations that emphasize customisability, collaborative use, and support for routine-based navigation. Our findings highlight key challenges and adaptive practices, which are synthesized into design recommendations that prioritize customisability, routine-based navigation, and multi-user coordination.

Offloading MoE expert parameters to host memory and leveraging both CPU and GPU computation has recently emerged as a promising direction to support such models on resourceconstrained local PC platforms. While promising, we notice that existing approaches mismatch the dynamic nature of expert workloads, which leads to three fundamental inefficiencies: (1) Static expert assignment causes severe CPUGPU load imbalance, underutilizing CPU and GPU resources; (2) Existing prefetching techniques fail to accurately predict high-workload experts, leading to costly inaccurate prefetches; (3) GPU cache policies neglect workload dynamics, resulting in poor hit rates and limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose DALI, a workloaDAware offLoadIng framework for efficient MoE inference on local PCs. To fully utilize hardware resources, DALI first dynamically assigns experts to CPU or GPU by modeling assignment as a 0-1 integer optimization problem and solving it efficiently using a Greedy Assignment strategy at runtime. To improve prefetching accuracy, we develop a Residual-Based Prefetching method leveraging inter-layer residual information to accurately predict high-workload experts. Additionally, we introduce a Workload-Aware Cache Replacement policy that exploits temporal correlation in expert activations to improve GPU cache efficiency. By evaluating across various MoE models and settings, DALI achieves significant speedups in the both prefill and decoding phases over the state-of-the-art offloading frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "DALI \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u914d\u3001\u6b8b\u5dee\u9884\u53d6\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u672c\u5730PC\u4e0a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5339\u914d\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4 CPU-GPU \u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u9884\u53d6\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548cGPU\u7f13\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6d6a\u8d39\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "DALI \u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u914d\uff08\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a0-1\u6574\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\uff09\u3001\u6b8b\u5dee\u9884\u53d6\uff08\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u95f4\u6b8b\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e13\u5bb6\uff09\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u7f13\u5b58\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5229\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a MoE \u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cDALI \u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5378\u8f7d\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "DALI \u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684 MoE \u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As users move, frequent SFC reconfigurations are required, but these are non-trivial: SFCs can serve users only when all required virtual network functions (VNFs) are available, and VNFs undergo time-consuming lifecycle operations before becoming operational. We show that ignoring lifecycle dynamics oversimplifies deployment, jeopardizes QoS, and must be avoided in practical SFC management. To address this, forecasts of user connectivity can be leveraged to proactively deploy VNFs and reconfigure SFCs. But forecasts are inherently imperfect, requiring lifecycle and connectivity uncertainty to be jointly considered. We present RIPPLE, a lifecycle-aware SFC embedding approach to deploy VNFs at the right time and location, reducing service interruptions.

It advances a forward-looking perspective on the next generation of formal methods based on the integration of automated contract synthesis, semantic artifact reuse, and refinement-based theory. We argue that future verification systems must move beyond isolated correctness proofs toward a cumulative, knowledge-driven paradigm in which specifications, contracts, and proofs are continuously synthesised and transferred across systems. To support this shift, we outline a hybrid framework combining large language models with graph-based representations to enable scalable semantic matching and principled reuse of verification artifacts. Learning-based components provide semantic guidance across heterogeneous notations and abstraction levels, while symbolic matching ensures formal soundness.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven xApps, in the near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), can learn from network data, anticipate future conditions, and dynamically adapt radio configurations. However, their development and adoption are hindered by the complexity of low-level RAN control and monitoring message models exposed over the O-RAN E2 interface, limited interoperability across heterogeneous RAN software stacks, and the lack of developer-friendly frameworks. In this paper, we introduce xDevSM, a framework that significantly lowers the barrier to xApp development by unifying observability and control in O-RAN deployment. By exposing a rich set of Key Performance Measurements (KPMs) and enabling fine-grained radio resource management controls, xDevSM provides the essential foundation for practical AI-driven xApps. We validate xDevSM on real-world testbeds, leveraging Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) devices together with heterogeneous RAN hardware, including Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)-based Software-defined Radios (SDRs) and Foxconn radio units, and show its seamless interoperability across multiple open-source RAN software stacks. Furthermore, we discuss and evaluate the capabilities of our framework through three O-RAN-based scenarios of high interest: (i) KPM-based monitoring of network performance, (ii) slice-level Physical Resource Block (PRB) allocation control across multiple User Equipments (UEs) and slices, and (iii) mobility-aware handover control, showing that xDevSM can implement intelligent closed-loop applications, laying the groundwork for learning-based optimization in heterogeneous RAN deployments. xDevSM is open source and available as foundational tool for the research community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fax sanctionSMS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316O-RAN\u4e2dAI\u9a71\u52a8xApp\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u5f02\u6784RAN\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "xApp\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u4e8eO-RAN E2\u63a5\u53e3\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7RAN\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u5f02\u6784RAN\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6808\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u53cb\u597d\u6846\u67b6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8AI\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165xDevSM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08KPM\uff09\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u63a5\u53e3\u652f\u6301AI\u9a71\u52a8xApp\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5546\u7528\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\uff08\u5982USRP\u548cFoxconn\u5355\u5143\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u540e\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u591a\u5f00\u6e90RAN\u6808\u65e0\u7f1d\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2aO-RAN\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1aKPM\u76d1\u63a7\u3001PRB\u5206\u914d\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5207\u6362\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u652f\u6301\u667a\u80fd\u95ed\u73af\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u8207\u6548\u679c\u0442\u0438\u043c\u3002", "conclusion": "xDevSM\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784RAN\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u5960\u5b9a\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u667a\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u4f9b\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, even advanced prompting workflows like progressive prompting often leave some requirements unmet. Although methods such as self-critique, multi-model collaboration, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have been proposed to address these gaps, developers lack clear guidance on when to use each. In an empirical study of 25 GitHub projects, we found that progressive prompting achieves 96.9% average task completion, significantly outperforming direct prompting (80.5%, Cohen's d=1.63, p<0.001) but still leaving 8 projects incomplete. For 6 of the most representative projects, we evaluated each enhancement strategy across 4 failure types. Our results reveal that method effectiveness depends critically on failure characteristics: Self-Critique succeeds on code-reviewable logic errors but fails completely on external service integration (0% improvement), while RAG achieves highest completion across all failure types with superior efficiency.

Yet existing SZZ-based approaches are limited by their reliance on git blame, which restricts the search space to commits that directly modified the fixed lines. Our preliminary study on 2,102 validated bug-fixing commits reveals that this limitation is significant: over 40% of cases cannot be solved by blame alone, as 28% of BICs require traversing commit history beyond blame results and 14% are blameless.\n  We present AgenticSZZ, the first approach to apply Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to software evolution analysis. AgenticSZZ reframes BIC identification from a ranking problem over blame commits into a graph search problem, where temporal ordering is fundamental to causal reasoning about bug introduction. The approach operates in two phases: (1) constructing a TKG that encodes commits with temporal and structural relationships, expanding the search space by traversing file history backward from two reference points (blame commits and the BFC); and (2) leveraging an LLM agent to navigate the graph using specialized tools for candidate exploration and causal analysis.\n  Evaluation on three datasets shows that AgenticSZZ achieves F1-scores of 0.48 to 0.74, with statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art by up to 27%. Our ablation study confirms that both components are essential, reflecting a classic exploration-exploitation trade-off: the TKG expands the search space while the agent provides intelligent selection.

In this paper, we investigate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate test framework migrations from \\texttt{unittest} to \\texttt{Pytest}. We evaluate GPT 4o and Claude Sonnet 4 under three prompting strategies (Zero-shot, One-shot, and Chain-of-Thought) and two temperature settings (0.0 and 1.0). To support this analysis, we first introduce a curated dataset of real-world migrations extracted from the top 100 Python open-source projects. Next, we actually execute the LLM-generated test migrations in their respective test suites. Overall, we find that 51.5% of the LLM-generated test migrations failed, while 48.5% passed. The results suggest that LLMs can accelerate test migration, but there are often caveats.

In this short paper, we provide an initial empirical study to understand bug-reproducing tests better. We analyze 642 bug-reproducing tests of 15 real-world Python systems. Overall, we find that bug-reproducing tests are not (statistically significantly) different from other tests regarding LOC, number of assertions, and complexity. However, bug-reproducing tests contain slightly more try/except blocks and ``weak assertions'' (e.g.,~\\texttt{assertNotEqual}).

In this paper, we present an empirical study to understand better how software testing is approached in contribution guidelines.

Furthermore, test documentation commonly explains how to run tests (83.5\\%), but less often provides guidance on how to write tests (37\\%).

We identify a gap in UT training data: repository-mined tests lack developer CoTs, while LLM-distilled CoTs are often incorrect or incomplete. To address this issue, we propose a novel data-distillation approach that uses self-debugging to produce high-quality UT training examples paired with faithful CoTs. Our approach combines (1) guided test repair, a heuristic loop (error-, failure-, and coverage-focused steps) that asks the used model to diagnose and iteratively fix generated tests, and (2) CoT compression, which compacts original and debugging CoTs into concise explanations that directly justify correct tests. We apply this pipeline to a large corpus of open-source projects to construct a dataset of 74,518 high-quality <focal method, test, CoT> examples, and then use it for supervised fine-tuning of a base model. An empirical evaluation shows that the fine-tuned model achieves high UT generation effectiveness: it attains a pass rate of 36.17% on test assertions, a branch coverage of 43.90%, and a mutation score of 88.66%, substantially higher than state-of-the-art commercial models like o4-mini.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u8c03\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5fe0\u5b9eCoT\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347UT\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709UT\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u96be\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u5907\u6b63\u786e\u65ad\u8a00\u548c\u53ef\u9760CoT\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u95ee\u9898\u6839\u6e90\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u4ed3\u5e93\u6316\u6398\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005CoT\uff0c\u800cLLM\u84b8\u998f\u7684CoT\u5e38\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f15\u5bfc\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4fee\u590d\uff08\u5305\u542b\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7126\u70b9\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u81ea\u8c03\u8bd5\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fee\u6b63\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u548cCoT\u538b\u7f29\uff08\u7cbe\u7b80\u539f\u59cb\u53ca\u8c03\u8bd5CoT\u4e3a\u5408\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u542b75518\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf<\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001CoT>\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65ad\u8a00\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u8fbe36.17%\uff0c\u5206\u652f\u8986\u76d6\u738743.90%\uff0c\u53d8\u5f02\u5206\u657088.66%\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u5982o4-mini\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u586b\u8865\u4e86UT\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548cCoT\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4fdd\u969c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved automatic code summarization, the practical usefulness of generated summaries in industrial settings remains insufficiently explored. In collaboration with documentation experts from the industrial HarmonyOS project, we conducted a questionnaire study showing that over 57.4% of code summaries produced by state-of-the-art approaches were rejected due to violations of developers' expectations for industrial documentation. Beyond semantic similarity to reference summaries, developers emphasize additional requirements, including the use of appropriate domain terminology, explicit function categorization, and the avoidance of redundant implementation details.\n  To address these expectations, we propose ExpSum, an expectation-aware code summarization approach that integrates function metadata abstraction, informative metadata filtering, context-aware domain knowledge retrieval, and constraint-driven prompting to guide LLMs in generating structured, expectation-aligned summaries. We evaluate ExpSum on the HarmonyOS project and widely used code summarization benchmarks. Experimental results show that ExpSum consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving improvements of up to 26.71% in BLEU-4 and 20.10% in ROUGE-L on HarmonyOS.

Most existing approaches rely on execution feedback from containerized environments, which require dependency-complete setup and physical execution of programs and tests. While effective, this paradigm is resource-intensive and difficult to maintain, substantially complicating agent training and limiting scalability. We propose SWE-World, a Docker-free framework that replaces physical execution environments with a learned surrogate for training and evaluating software engineering agents. SWE-World leverages LLM-based models trained on real agent-environment interaction data to predict intermediate execution outcomes and final test feedback, enabling agents to learn without interacting with physical containerized environments. This design preserves the standard agent-environment interaction loop while eliminating the need for costly environment construction and maintenance during agent optimization and evaluation. Furthermore, because SWE-World can simulate the final evaluation outcomes of candidate trajectories without real submission, it enables selecting the best solution among multiple test-time attempts, thereby facilitating effective test-time scaling (TTS) in software engineering tasks. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that SWE-World raises Qwen2.5-Coder-32B from 6.2\\% to 52.0\\% via Docker-free SFT, 55.0\\% with Docker-free RL, and 68.2\\% with further TTS.

However, application-level generation requires producing a runnable multi-file repository with correct structure, dependencies, and end-to-end executability, and real-world software must satisfy both functional correctness and non-functional quality (e.g., maintainability, security). Existing benchmarks provide a limited execution-based assessment of these requirements at the application level. We ask: Can current LLMs generate application-level repositories that meet both functional and non-functional criteria? We propose RAL-Bench, a benchmark and evaluation framework for application-level code generation. For each task, we distill a concise natural-language requirement from a high-quality reference project, build black-box system tests covering functional and non-functional attributes, and keep only tests that pass on the reference repository to ensure a sound oracle and an end-to-end executable suite. Functional correctness is measured by system-test pass rate. Non-functional quality is measured along five ISO/IEC 25010-inspired dimensions and aggregated with an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-derived weight vector, with per-dimension diagnostics and baseline-normalized scoring using reference measurements. Across 16 LLMs evaluated zero-shot with greedy decoding, functional correctness is the dominant bottleneck: no model exceeds a 45% functional pass rate under our requirement-driven, reference-validated tests.

Assurance Cases (ACs) provide structured arguments supported by evidence, but generating and maintaining this evidence is labour-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to keep consistent as systems evolve. We present a model-based approach to systematically generating AC evidence by embedding formal verification into the assurance workflow. The approach addresses three challenges: systematically deriving formal assertions from natural language requirements using templates, orchestrating multiple formal verification tools to handle diverse property types, and integrating formal evidence production into the workflow. Leveraging RoboChart, a domain-specific modelling language with formal semantics, we combine model checking and theorem proving in our approach. Structured requirements are automatically transformed into formal assertions using predefined templates, and verification results are automatically integrated as evidence.

Thus, they provide an ambiguous signal about the quality of the code and interfere with the automated assessment of code changes. While a variety of factors can cause test flakiness, approaches to fix flaky tests are typically tailored to address specific causes. However, the prevalent root causes of flaky tests can vary depending on the programming language, application domain, or size of the software project. Since manually labeling flaky tests is time-consuming and tedious, this work proposes an LLMs-as-annotators approach that leverages intra- and inter-model consistency to label issue reports related to fixed flakiness issues with the relevant root cause category. This allows us to gain an overview of prevalent flakiness categories in the issue reports. We evaluated our labeling approach in the context of SAP HANA, a large industrial database management system. Our results suggest that SAP HANA's tests most commonly suffer from issues related to concurrency (23%, 130 of 559 analyzed issue reports).

However, existing TDD-style code generation studies are largely limited to function-level tasks, leaving class-level synthesis where multiple methods interact through shared state and call dependencies underexplored. In this paper, we scale test-driven code generation from functions to classes via an iterative TDD framework. Our approach first analyzes intra-class method dependencies to derive a feasible generation schedule, and then incrementally implements each method under method-level public tests with reflection-style execution feedback and bounded repair iterations. To support test-driven generation and rigorous class-level evaluation, we construct ClassEval-TDD, a cleaned and standardized variant of ClassEval with consistent specifications, deterministic test environments, and complete method-level public tests. We conduct an empirical study across eight LLMs and compare against the strongest direct-generation baseline (the best of holistic, incremental, and compositional strategies). Our class-level TDD framework consistently improves class-level correctness by 12 to 26 absolute points and achieves up to 71% fully correct classes, while requiring only a small number of repairs on average. These results demonstrate that test-driven generation can effectively scale beyond isolated functions and substantially improve class-level code generation reliability.

At BNY Mellon, we conduct a survey with 2989 developer responses and 11 in-depth interviews. Our findings demonstrate that a multifaceted approach is needed to measure AI productivity impacts: survey results expose conflicting perspectives on AI tool usefulness, while interviews elicit six distinct factors that capture both short-term and long-term dimensions of productivity. In contrast to prior work, our factors highlight the importance of long-term metrics like technical expertise and ownership of work.

This is particularly true in the case of Language Model (LM) enabled systems where the autoregressive nature of token generation introduces variability in latency, energy usage and response quality. These systems, powered by LLMs, are either resource-intensive (if run on-prem) or raise privacy/cost concerns (if leveraged using APIs). While deploying a Small Language Model (SLM) can be resource-efficient, it often falls short in addressing the diversity and scale of real-world requirements. To this, we argue that, rather than relying on any one SLM, leveraging a coordinated fleet of SLMs, each with specialized strengths can enable systems to dynamically adapt to shifting contexts and workload patterns. However, realizing the full potential of such an approach demands intelligent orchestration and continuous adaptation. To this end, we introduce CALM , a self-adaptive orchestration mechanism based on MAPE-K. Our approach continuously monitors user queries, analyzes the QoS metrics of the SLMs, identifies the optimal SLM to be used, routes the query to the identified SLM and further to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency, leverages caching and scheduling to decide the SLMs to be kept in memory. Our evaluation shows that CALM reduces latency by approximately 40% and energy consumption by 50%, while preserving domain-specific task performance when compared to single-LLM baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdCALM\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u8230\u961f\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5982\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\uff08QoS\uff09\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\uff0cSLM\u867d\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u96be\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u7f16\u6392SLM\u8230\u961f\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "CALM\u57fa\u4e8eMAPE-K\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5206\u6790SLMs\u7684QoS\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18SLM\u8def\u7531\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u5b58SLM\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00LLM\u57fa\u51c6\uff0cCALM\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea640%\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u80fd\u801750%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u8c03\u4e13\u4e1aSLM\u8230\u961f\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u7f16\u6392\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

In contrast to code generation, refactoring demands precise, semantics-preserving edits that improve program structure, which also makes automated evaluation challenging. However, existing refactoring benchmarks commonly suffer from three shortcomings: limited coverage of refactoring scenarios, the inclusion of instances that mix refactoring with unrelated changes, and insufficient repository-level context for realistic assessment. To mitigate these issues, we introduce SWE-Refactor, a new benchmark for LLM-based code refactoring. SWE-Refactor comprises 1,099 developer-written, behavior-preserving refactorings mined from 18 Java projects, including 922 atomic and 177 compound instances. Each instance is validated via compilation, test execution, and automated refactoring detection tools to ensure correctness. We evaluate nine widely used LLMs on SWE-Refactor, covering models such as GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and CodeLLaMa, to provide representative reference results. Our results show that complex and compound refactorings remain the primary source of failures; notably, an OpenAI Codex agent achieves only 39.4% success on compound instances.

Bug-finding techniques exist, but without precise API specifications, they produce many false alarms. Existing methods to mine API specifications lack accuracy. We explore using ML classifiers to determine input validity. We hypothesize that tensor shapes are a precise abstraction to encode concrete inputs and capture relationships of the data. Shape abstraction severely reduces problem dimensionality, which is important to facilitate ML training. Labeled data are obtained by observing runtime outcomes on a sample of inputs and classifiers are trained on sets of labeled inputs to capture API constraints. Our evaluation, conducted over 183 APIs from TensorFlow and Pytorch, shows that the classifiers generalize well on unseen data with over 91% accuracy. Integrating these classifiers into the pipeline of ACETest, a SoTA bug-finding technique, improves its pass rate from ~29% to ~61%.

However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
