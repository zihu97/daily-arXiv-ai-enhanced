Energy-aware solutions use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to mitigate overheating in performance-intensive scenarios, while software approaches allocate high-utilization tasks across core configurations in parallel systems to reduce power. However, existing heuristics lack per-core frequency monitoring, failing to address overheating from uneven core activity, and task assignments without detailed profiling overlook irregular execution patterns. We target OpenMP DAG workloads. Because makespan, energy, and thermal goals often conflict within a single benchmark, this work prioritizes performance (makespan) while reporting energy and thermal as secondary outcomes. To overcome these issues, we propose HiDVFS (a hierarchical multi-agent, performance-aware DVFS scheduler) for parallel systems that optimizes task allocation based on profiling data, core temperatures, and makespan-first objectives. It employs three agents: one selects cores and frequencies using profiler data, another manages core combinations via temperature sensors, and a third sets task priorities during resource contention. A makespan-focused reward with energy and temperature regularizers estimates future states and enhances sample efficiency. Experiments on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 using the BOTS suite (9 benchmarks) compare HiDVFS against state-of-the-art approaches. With multi-seed validation (seeds 42, 123, 456), HiDVFS achieves the best finetuned performance with 4.16 plus/minus 0.58s average makespan (L10), representing a 3.44x speedup over GearDVFS (14.32 plus/minus 2.61s) and 50.4% energy reduction (63.7 kJ vs 128.4 kJ).

Spot instances offer 3-10x lower cost than on-demand instances, but their unpredictable availability makes meeting deadlines difficult. Existing systems either rely solely on spot instances and risk deadline violations, or operate in simplified single-region settings. These approaches overlook substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity in spot availability, lifetimes, and prices. We show that exploiting such heterogeneity to access more spot capacity is the key to reduce the job execution cost. We present SkyNomad, a multi-region scheduling system that maximizes spot usage and minimizes cost while guaranteeing deadlines. SkyNomad uses lightweight probing to estimate availability, predicts spot lifetimes, accounts for migration cost, and unifies regional characteristics and deadline pressure into a monetary cost model that guides scheduling decisions.

Widely used performance models primarily focus on cache and memory bandwidth, which is suitable for many memory-bound workloads. However, it is unsuitable for highly arithmetic intensive cases such as the sum-factorization with tensor $n$-mode product kernels, which are an optimization technique for high-order finite element methods (FEM). On processors with relatively high single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instruction latency, such as the Fujitsu A64FX, the performance of these kernels is strongly influenced by loop-body splitting strategies. Memory-bandwidth-oriented models are therefore not appropriate for evaluating these splitting configurations, and a model that directly reflects instruction-level efficiency is required. To address this need, we develop a dependency-chain-based analytical formulation that links loop-splitting configurations to instruction dependencies in the tensor $n$-mode product kernel. We further use XGBoost to estimate key parameters in the analytical model that are difficult to model explicitly. Evaluations show that the learning-augmented model outperforms the widely used standard Roofline and Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) models. On the Fujitsu A64FX processor, the learning-augmented model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) between 1% and 24% for polynomial orders ($P$) from 1 to 15. In comparison, the standard Roofline and ECM models yield errors of 42%-256% and 5%-117%, respectively.

We introduce Contract2Plan, a verified GenAI-to-optimizer pipeline that inserts a solver-based compliance gate before plans are emitted. The system retrieves clause evidence with provenance, extracts a typed constraint schema with evidence spans, compiles constraints into a BOM-aware MILP, and verifies grounding, eligibility, consistency, and feasibility using solver diagnostics, triggering targeted repair or abstention when automation is unsafe. We formalize which clause classes admit conservative repair with contract-safe feasibility guarantees and which require human confirmation.

Despite their potential for scalable cooperation, current PI methods heavily depend on fixed incentive values that need to be appropriately chosen with respect to the environmental rewards and thus are highly sensitive to their changes. Therefore, they fail to maintain cooperation under changing rewards in the environment, e.g., caused by modified specifications, varying supply and demand, or sensory flaws - even when the conditions for mutual cooperation remain the same. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Reward Incentives for Variable Exchange (DRIVE), an adaptive PI approach to cooperation in social dilemmas with changing rewards. DRIVE agents reciprocally exchange reward differences to incentivize mutual cooperation in a completely decentralized way.

DRAG designs a reference direction and a metric named divergence of degree to quantify the deviation of local updates. Accordingly, each worker can align its local update via linear calibration without extra communication cost. BR-DRAG refines DRAG under Byzantine attacks by maintaining a vetted root dataset at the server to produce trusted reference directions. The workers' updates can be then calibrated to mitigate divergence caused by malicious attacks.

Existing deterministic approaches that combine heuristic signals, semantic similarity measures, and graph-based centrality metrics have demonstrated effectiveness in nar-rowing candidate search spaces, yet their recall plateaus. This limitation stems from the treatment of features as linearly independent contributors, ignoring contextual dependencies and relationships between metrics that characterize expert reasoning patterns. To address this limitation, we propose the application of Multi-Head Self-Attention as a post-deterministic scoring refinement mechanism. Our approach learns contextual weighting between features, dynamically adjust-ing importance levels per file based on relational behavior exhibited across candidate file sets. The attention mechanism produces context-aware adjustments that are additively combined with deterministic scores, pre-serving interpretability while enabling reasoning similar to that performed by experts when reviewing change surfaces. We focus on recall rather than precision, as false negatives (missing impacted files) are far more costly than false positives (irrelevant files that can be quickly dismissed during review).

Recent studies focus on hierarchical memory to model users' multi-granular behavioral patterns via clustering and aggregating historical conversations. However, conversational noise and memory hallucinations can be amplified during clustering, causing locally aggregated memories to misalign with the user's global persona. To mitigate this issue, we propose Bi-Mem, an agentic framework ensuring hierarchical memory fidelity through bidirectional construction. Specifically, we deploy an inductive agent to form the hierarchical memory: it extracts factual information from raw conversations to form fact-level memory, aggregates them into thematic scenes (i.e., local scene-level memory) using graph clustering, and infers users' profiles as global persona-level memory. Simultaneously, a reflective agent is designed to calibrate local scene-level memories using global constraints derived from the persona-level memory, thereby enforcing global-local alignment. For coherent memory recall, we propose an associative retrieval mechanism: beyond initial hierarchical search, a spreading activation process allows facts to evoke contextual scenes, while scene-level matches retrieve salient supporting factual information. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Bi-Mem achieves significant improvements in question answering performance on long-term personalized conversational tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bi-Mem\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u786e\u4fdd\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e7b\u89c9\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u88ab\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c40\u90e8\u805a\u5408\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u5168\u5c40\u4eba\u8bbe\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u90e8\u7f72\u5f52\u7eb3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u3001\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u3001\u4eba\u8bbe\u7ea7\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cd\u601d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u8bbe\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u6821\u51c6\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u8054\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u8d2f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53ec\u56de\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cBi-Mem\u5728\u957f\u671f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Bi-Mem\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Code: https://github.com/studiofarzulla/friction-marl", "summary": "Multi-agent systems face a fundamental coordination problem: agents must coordinate despite heterogeneous preferences, asymmetric stakes, and imperfect information. When coordination fails, friction emerges: measurable resistance manifesting as deadlock, thrashing, communication overhead, or outright conflict. This paper derives a formal framework for analyzing coordination friction from a single axiom: actions affecting agents require authorization from those agents in proportion to stakes.\n  From this axiom of consent, we establish the kernel triple $(\u03b1, \u03c3, \u03b5)$ (alignment, stake, and entropy) characterizing any resource allocation configuration. The friction equation $F = \u03c3 (1 + \u03b5)/(1 + \u03b1)$ predicts coordination difficulty as a function of preference alignment $\u03b1$, stake magnitude $\u03c3$, and communication entropy $\u03b5$. The Replicator-Optimization Mechanism (ROM) governs evolutionary selection over coordination strategies: configurations generating less friction persist longer, establishing consent-respecting arrangements as dynamical attractors rather than normative ideals.\n  We develop formal definitions for resource consent, coordination legitimacy, and friction-aware allocation in multi-agent systems. The framework yields testable predictions: MARL systems with higher reward alignment exhibit faster convergence; distributed allocations accounting for stake asymmetry generate lower coordination failure; AI systems with interpretability deficits produce friction proportional to the human-AI alignment gap. Applications to cryptocurrency governance and political systems demonstrate that the same equations govern friction dynamics across domains, providing a complexity science perspective on coordination under preference heterogeneity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u610f\u516c\u7406\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u6469\u64e6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u03b1, \u03c3, \u03b5\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u534f\u8c03\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6469\u64e6\u65b9\u7a0b F = \u03c3(1+\u03b5)/(1+\u03b1)\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4f4e\u6469\u64e6\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56e0\u504f\u597d\u5f02\u8d28\u3001\u6743\u76ca\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6469\u64e6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u2018\u884c\u52a8\u9700\u6309\u6743\u76ca\u6bd4\u4f8b\u83b7\u5f97\u6388\u6743\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u540c\u610f\u516c\u7406\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6838\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u03b1\u3001\u6743\u76ca\u03c3\u3001\u71b5\u03b5\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6469\u64e6\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff08ROM\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u7b56\u7565\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u52a0\u901fMARL\u6536\u655b\u3001\u8003\u8651\u6743\u76ca\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u964d\u4f4e\u534f\u8c03\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0e\u4eba\u673a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u8ddd\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ea7\u751f\u6469\u64e6\u7b49\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u5bc6\u6cbb\u7406\u4e0e\u653f\u6cbb\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u8c03\u6469\u64e6\u662f\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u610f\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u9884\u6d4b\u529b\uff0c\u4ea6\u63ed\u793a\u5c0a\u91cd\u6743\u76ca\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0a\u5177\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

A core model within this paradigm is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where lightweight functions are deployed and triggered on demand, scaling seamlessly with workload. FaaS offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and fine-grained scalability, qualities particularly relevant for large-scale scientific infrastructures where data volumes are too large to centralise and computation must increasingly occur close to the data. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) exemplifies this challenge. Once operational, it will generate about 700~PB of data products annually, distributed across the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet), a federation of international centres providing storage, computing, and analysis services. In such a context, FaaS offers a mechanism to bring computation to the data. We studied the principles of serverless and FaaS computing and explored their application to radio astronomy workflows. Representative functions for astrophysical data analysis were developed and deployed, including micro-functions derived from existing libraries and wrappers around domain-specific applications. In particular, a Gaussian convolution function was implemented and integrated within the SRCNet ecosystem. The use case demonstrates that FaaS can be embedded into the existing SRCNet ecosystem of services, allowing functions to run directly at sites where data replicas are stored. This reduces latency, minimises transfers, and improves efficiency, aligning with federated, data-proximate computation. The results show that serverless models provide a scalable and efficient pathway to address the data volumes of the SKA era.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u548cFaaS\u5728SKAO\u5929\u6587\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "SKAO\u6bcf\u5e74\u751f\u6210700PB\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c31\u8fd1\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u90e8\u7f72\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5929\u6587\u5206\u6790\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u65af\u5377\u79ef\uff09\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u81f3SRCNet\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "FaaS\u6210\u529f\u5d4c\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u8fd1\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4f20\u8f93\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u4e3aSKA\u65f6\u4ee3\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, little is known about how SATD manifests and evolves in contemporary Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, whose architectures, workflows, and dependencies differ fundamentally from both traditional and pre-LLM ML software. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of SATD in the LLM era, replicating and extending prior work on ML technical debt to modern LLM-based systems. We compare SATD prevalence across LLM, ML, and non-ML repositories across a total of 477 repositories (159 per category). We perform survival analysis of SATD introduction and removal to understand the dynamics of technical debt across different development paradigms. Surprisingly, despite their architectural complexity, our results reveal that LLM repositories accumulate SATD at similar rates to ML systems (3.95% vs. 4.10%). However, we observe that LLM repositories remain debt-free 2.4x longer than ML repositories (a median of 492 days vs. 204 days), and then start to accumulate technical debt rapidly. Moreover, our qualitative analysis of 377 SATD instances reveals three new forms of technical debt unique to LLM-based development that have not been reported in prior research: Model-Stack Workaround Debt, Model Dependency Debt, and Performance Optimization Debt. Finally, by mapping SATD to stages of the LLM development pipeline, we observe that debt concentrates", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u8ba4\u6280\u672f\u503a\uff08SATD\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u79ef\u7d2f\u901f\u7387\u4e0eML\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u503a\u671f\u66f4\u957f\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u578bLLM\u7279\u6709\u503a\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dSATD\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9LLM\u65f6\u4ee3\u6280\u672f\u503a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790477\u4e2a\u4ed3\u5e93\uff08LLM/ML/\u975eML\u5404159\u4e2a\uff09\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u8bc6\u522bSATD\u5f15\u5165\u4e0e\u79fb\u9664\u52a8\u6001\u53ca\u65b0\u578b\u503a\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "LLM\u4ed3\u5e93SATD\u79ef\u7d2f\u73873.95%\uff0c\u65e0\u503a\u671f\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570492\u5929\uff08ML\u4e3a204\u5929\uff09\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u7c7b\u65b0\u503a\u52a1\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u6808\u6743\u5b9c\u503a\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u503a\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u503a\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f46\u521d\u671f\u6297\u503a\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u503a\u52a1\u589e\u957f\u5feb\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6cbb\u7406\u5176\u7279\u6709\u503a\u52a1\u5f62\u6001\u3002"}}

While this evolution enables adaptive behavior, it also heightens vulnerability to stressors such as environmental changes and adversarial behavior. Existing literature on resilience in decentralized MAS largely focuses on isolated aspects, such as fault tolerance, without offering a principled unified definition of multi-agent resilience. This gap limits the ability to design systems that can continuously sense, adapt, and recover under dynamic conditions. This article proposes a formal definition of MAS resilience grounded in two complementary dimensions: epistemic resilience, wherein agents recover and sustain accurate knowledge of the environment, and action resilience, wherein agents leverage that knowledge to coordinate and sustain goals under disruptions. We formalize resilience via temporal epistemic logic and quantify it using recoverability time (how quickly desired properties are re-established after a disturbance) and durability time (how long accurate beliefs and goal-directed behavior are sustained after recovery). We design an agent architecture and develop decentralized algorithms to achieve both epistemic and action resilience. We provide formal verification guarantees, showing that our specifications are sound with respect to the metric bounds and admit finite-horizon verification, enabling design-time certification and lightweight runtime monitoring. Through a case study on distributed multi-agent decision-making under stressors, we show that our approach outperforms baseline methods. Our formal verification analysis and simulation results highlight that the proposed framework enables resilient, knowledge-driven decision-making and sustained operation, laying the groundwork for resilient decentralized MAS in next-generation communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u97e7\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u63016G\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u97e7\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba4\u77e5\u97e7\u6027\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u97e7\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5e94\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u97e7\u6027\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

The system characterizes the interaction between offload strategies and IPC execution, including synchronization, cache visibility, and concurrency, and introduces multiple IPC modes that balance throughput, latency, and CPU efficiency.\n  Through asynchronous pipelining, selective cache injection, and hybrid coordination, the system turns offloading from a device-specific feature into a general system capability. Evaluations on real-world workloads show instruction count reductions of up to 22%, throughput improvements of up to 2.1x, and latency reductions of up to 72%, demonstrating that coordinated IPC offloading can deliver tangible end-to-end efficiency gains in modern data-intensive systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684IPC\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u5185\u5b58\u5378\u8f7d\u4f18\u5316\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709IPC\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u670d\u52a1\u65f6\u8017\u8d39\u5927\u91cfCPU\u5468\u671f\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u62f7\u8d1d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u8c03\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u5378\u8f7d\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u5185\u5b58\u5378\u8f7d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5f02\u6b65\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7f13\u5b58\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cdIPC\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e73\u8861\u541e\u5410\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0eCPU\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u6d4b\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a22%\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe2.1\u500d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe72%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u8c03\u5f0fIPC\u5378\u8f7d\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Along with these developments, challenges and opportunities exist in the field of Quantum Software Engineering, as the development of frameworks and higher-level abstractions has attracted practitioners from diverse backgrounds. Unlike initial quantum frameworks based on the circuit model, recent frameworks and libraries leverage higher-level abstractions for creating quantum programs. This paper presents an empirical study of 985 Jupyter Notebooks from 80 open-source projects to investigate how quantum patterns are applied in practice. Our work involved two main stages. First, we built a knowledge base from three quantum computing frameworks (Qiskit, PennyLane, and Classiq). This process led us to identify and document 9 new patterns that refine and extend the existing quantum computing pattern catalog. Second, we developed a reusable semantic search tool to automatically detect these patterns across our large-scale dataset, providing a practitioner-focused analysis. Our results show that developers use patterns in three levels: from foundational circuit utilities, to common algorithmic primitives (e.g., Amplitude Amplification), up to domain-specific applications for finance and optimization.

To bridge this gap, we propose DarwinTOD, a lifelong self evolving dialog framework that systematically integrates these two paradigms, enabling continuous strategy optimization from a zero-shot base without task specific fine-tuning.

Evaluating LLMs in Resolving Context Adaptation Bugs During Code Adaptation", "comment": "24 pages, 11 figures, accepted by FSE 2026", "summary": "Code adaptation is a fundamental but challenging task in software development, requiring developers to modify existing code for new contexts. A key challenge is to resolve Context Adaptation Bugs (CtxBugs), which occurs when code correct in its original context violates constraints in the target environment. Unlike isolated bugs, CtxBugs cannot be resolved through local fixes and require cross-context reasoning to identify semantic mismatches. Overlooking them may lead to critical failures in adaptation. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in automating code-related tasks, their ability to resolve CtxBugs remains a significant and unexplored obstacle to their practical use in code adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose CtxBugGen, a novel framework for generating CtxBugs to evaluate LLMs. Its core idea is to leverage LLMs' tendency to generate plausible but context-free code when contextual constraints are absent. The framework generates CtxBugs through a four-step process to ensure their relevance and validity: (1) Adaptation Task Selection, (2) Task-specific Perturbation,(3) LLM-based Variant Generation and (4) CtxBugs Identification. Based on the benchmark constructed by CtxBugGen, we conduct an empirical study with four state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal their unsatisfactory performance in CtxBug resolution. The best performing LLM, Kimi-K2, achieves 55.93% on Pass@1 and resolves just 52.47% of CtxBugs. The presence of CtxBugs degrades LLMs' adaptation performance by up to 30%. Failure analysis indicates that LLMs often overlook CtxBugs and replicate them in their outputs.

This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the CREATE-IF-LATE (CIL) algorithm, which is a fully decentralized, resilient mechanism that enables self-creating RWs and prevents RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis shows that the CIL algorithm guarantees several desirable properties, such as (i) non-extinction of the RW population, (ii) almost sure boundedness of the RW population, and (iii) convergence of RW-based stochastic gradient descent even in the presence of Pac-Man with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Moreover, the learning process experiences at most a linear time delay due to Pac-Man interruptions and RW regeneration. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and public benchmark datasets validate our theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCREATE-IF-LATE\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u62b5\u5fa1Pac-Man\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u7b97\u6cd5\u6613\u53d7\u6076\u610f\u8282\u70b9\u7ec8\u6b62\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u9690\u853d\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u969c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684CREATE-IF-LATE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u81ea\u6211\u518d\u751f\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6297\u706d\u7edd\u3001\u6709\u754c\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1CIL\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1Pac-Man\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6700\u591a\u4ec5\u7ebf\u6027\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "CIL\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

For rigorous evaluation, the authors introduce FixtureEval, a dedicated benchmark comprising 600 curated functions across two Programming Languages (PLs), i.e., Python and Java, with explicit fixture dependency labels, enabling both the corresponding classification and generation tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that Fixturize is highly effective, achieving 88.38%-97.00% accuracy across benchmarks in identifying the dependence of test fixtures and significantly enhancing the Suite Pass rate (SuitePS) by 18.03%-42.86% on average across both PLs with the auto-generated fixtures. Owing to the maintenance of test fixtures, Fixturize further improves line/branch coverage when integrated with existing testing tools of both LLM-based and Search-based by 16.85%/24.08% and 31.54%/119.66% on average, respectively.

Fairness issues have attracted increasing attention since machine learning software is increasingly used for high-stakes and high-risk decisions. It is the responsibility of all software developers to make their software accountable by ensuring that the machine learning software do not perform differently on different sensitive groups -- satisfying the separation criterion. However, evaluation of separation requires ground truth labels for each test data point. This motivates our work on analyzing whether separation can be evaluated on comparative judgment test data. Instead of asking humans to provide the ratings or categorical labels on each test data point, comparative judgments are made between pairs of data points such as A is better than B. According to the law of comparative judgment, providing such comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden for humans than providing ratings or categorical labels. This work first defines the novel fairness notion comparative separation on comparative judgment test data, and the metrics to evaluate comparative separation. Then, both theoretically and empirically, we show that in binary classification problems, comparative separation is equivalent to separation. Lastly, we analyze the number of test data points and test data pairs required to achieve the same level of statistical power in the evaluation of separation and comparative separation, respectively. This work is the first to explore fairness evaluation on comparative judgment test data.

Traditional syntax and semantic-based parsers often struggle with semantic variations in evolving logs and data scarcity stemming from their limited domain coverage. Recent large language model (LLM)-based parsers leverage in-context learning (ICL) to extract semantics from examples, demonstrating superior accuracy. However, LLM-based parsers face two main challenges: 1) underutilization of ICL capabilities, particularly in dynamic example selection and cross-domain generalization, leading to inconsistent performance; 2) time-consuming and costly LLM querying. To address these challenges, we present MicLog, the first progressive meta in-context learning (ProgMeta-ICL) log parsing framework that combines meta-learning with ICL on small open-source LLMs (i.e., Qwen-2.5-3B). Specifically, MicLog: i) enhances LLMs' ICL capability through a zero-shot to k-shot ProgMeta-ICL paradigm, employing weighted DBSCAN candidate sampling and enhanced BM25 demonstration selection; ii) accelerates parsing via a multi-level pre-query cache that dynamically matches and refines recently parsed templates. Evaluated on Loghub-2.0, MicLog achieves 10.3% higher parsing accuracy than the state-of-the-art parser while reducing parsing time by 42.4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "MicLog\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8017\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u793a\u4f8b\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProgMeta-ICL\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a0\u6743DBSCAN\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3aBM25\u793a\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7ea7\u9884\u67e5\u8be2\u7f13\u5b58\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728Loghub-2.0\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534710.3%\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1142.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "MicLog\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u5728\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Yet, their adoption within agile environments remains underexplored. Objective: This study investigates how agile practitioners adopt GenAI tools in real-world organizational contexts, focusing on regulatory conditions, use cases, benefits, and barriers. Method: An exploratory multiple case study was conducted in three German organizations, involving 17 semi-structured interviews and document analysis. A cross-case thematic analysis was applied to identify GenAI adoption patterns. Results: Findings reveal that GenAI is primarily used for creative tasks, documentation, and code assistance. Benefits include efficiency gains and enhanced creativity, while barriers relate to data privacy, validation effort, and lack of governance. Using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, we find that these barriers stem from misalignments across the three dimensions. Regulatory pressures are often translated into policies without accounting for actual technological usage patterns or organizational constraints. This leads to systematic gaps between policy and practice.

Our analysis identifies three distinct development profiles: sustained, steady, and burst-driven. These profiles reflect substantial variation in ecosystem maturity. Perfective commits constitute 40.8% of all changes, suggesting that feature enhancement is prioritized over corrective maintenance (27.4%) and adaptive updates (24.3%). Data about issues shows that the most frequent concerns involve bugs (22%), infrastructure (14%), and agent coordination challenges (10%). Issue reporting also increased sharply across all frameworks starting in 2023. Median resolution times range from under one day to about two weeks, with distributions skewed toward fast responses but a minority of issues requiring extended attention.

Many methods have been proposed in the literature to enhance software fairness. However, the majority behave as a black-box, not allowing stakeholders to prioritise fairness or effectiveness (i.e., prediction correctness) based on their needs. Aims: In this paper, we introduce FairRF, a novel approach based on multi-objective evolutionary search to optimise fairness and effectiveness in classification tasks. FairRF uses a Random Forest (RF) model as a base classifier and searches for the best hyperparameter configurations and data mutation to maximise fairness and effectiveness. Eventually, it returns a set of Pareto optimal solutions, allowing the final stakeholders to choose the best one based on their needs. Method: We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of FairRF against 26 different baselines in 11 different scenarios using five effectiveness and three fairness metrics. Additionally, we also include two variations of the fairness metrics for intersectional bias for a total of six definitions analysed. Result: Our results show that FairRF can significantly improve the fairness of base classifiers, while maintaining consistent prediction effectiveness. Additionally, FairRF provides a more consistent optimisation under all fairness definitions compared to state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods and overcomes the existing state-of-the-art approach for intersectional bias mitigation. Conclusions: FairRF is an effective approach for bias mitigation also allowing stakeholders to adapt the development of fair software systems based on their specific needs.", "AI": {"tldr": "FairRF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u6839\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u548cML\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8ba9\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u6743\u8861\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "FairRF\u4ee5\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f73\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6570\u636e\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFairRF\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FairRF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u9700\u6c42\u5b9a\u5236\u516c\u5e73\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating 29 LLMs on object-oriented design (OOD) tasks. Owing to the lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics, we introduce OODEval, a manually constructed benchmark comprising 50 OOD tasks of varying difficulty, and OODEval-Human, the first human-rated OOD benchmark, which includes 940 undergraduate-submitted class diagrams evaluated by instructors. We further propose CLUE (Class Likeness Unified Evaluation), a unified metric set that assesses both global correctness and fine-grained design quality in class diagram generation. Using these benchmarks and metrics, we investigate five research questions: overall correctness, comparison with humans, model dimension analysis, task feature analysis, and bad case analysis. The results indicate that while LLMs achieve high syntactic accuracy, they exhibit substantial semantic deficiencies, particularly in method and relationship generation. Among the evaluated models, Qwen3-Coder-30B achieves the best overall performance, rivaling DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4o, while Gemma3-4B-IT outperforms GPT-4o-Mini despite its smaller parameter scale. Although top-performing LLMs nearly match the average performance of undergraduates, they remain significantly below the level of the best human designers. Further analysis shows that parameter scale, code specialization, and instruction tuning strongly influence performance, whereas increased design complexity and lower requirement readability degrade it. Bad case analysis reveals common failure modes, including keyword misuse, missing classes or relationships, and omitted methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8629\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6OODEval\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807CLUE\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u867d\u8bed\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u4f46\u8bed\u4e49\u7f3a\u9677\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u4e13\u7cbe\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f25\u8865\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b50\u4e2aOOD\u4efb\u52a1\u7684OODEval\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u542b940\u4efd\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u7c7b\u56fe\u7684OODEval-Human\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCLUE\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u4e94\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "Qwen3-Coder-30B\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1DeepSeek-R1\u4e0eGPT-4o\uff1b\u5c0f\u6a21\u578bGemma3-4B-IT\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-4o-Mini\uff1b\u9876\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\u672c\u79d1\u751f\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u8fdc\u900a\u4e8e\u4f18\u79c0\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\uff1b\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u4e13\u7cbe\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728OOD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8bed\u4e49\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
