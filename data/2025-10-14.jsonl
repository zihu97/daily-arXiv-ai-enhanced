While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising\navenues for intervention, current applications are often siloed, addressing\nsingular aspects of the disease such as diagnostics or caregiver support\nwithout systemic integration. This paper proposes a novel methodological\nframework for a comprehensive, multi-agent system (MAS) designed for holistic\nAlzheimer's disease management. The objective is to detail the architecture of\na collaborative ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each engineered to address\na distinct challenge in the AD care continuum, from caregiver support and\nmultimodal data analysis to automated research and clinical data\ninterpretation. The proposed framework is composed of eight specialized,\ninteroperable agents. These agents are categorized by function: (1) Caregiver\nand Patient Support, (2) Data Analysis and Research, and (3) Advanced\nMultimodal Workflows. The methodology details the technical architecture of\neach agent, leveraging a suite of advanced technologies including large\nlanguage models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini, multi-agent orchestration\nframeworks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-grounded\nresponses, and specialized tools for web scraping, multimodal data processing,\nand in-memory database querying. This paper presents a detailed architectural\nblueprint for an integrated AI ecosystem for AD care. By moving beyond\nsingle-purpose tools to a collaborative, multi-agent paradigm, this framework\nestablishes a foundation for developing more adaptive, personalized, and\nproactive solutions. This methodological approach aims to pave the way for\nfuture systems capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve patient\noutcomes and reduce caregiver burden."}

Second, we propose\nGradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and\nmanipulating the Gradle build environment.

Yet most current\ndigital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data\ntypes, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper\nintroduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in\nsilico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial,\nbehavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model.\nImplemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports\nautomated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its\nontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and\ndiagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse\nevents), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively\nrefined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot\nstudy in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients.\nEvaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and\nGDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous\ndata, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive,\nand prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By\nbridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT\nprovides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems,\ntransforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and\nequitable management."}

However, its\nadoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict\nprivacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical\nsystems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering\n(MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies\non formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated\ntransformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At\nits core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that\nenables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning\npipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning\narchitecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw\npatient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving\nprivacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy\nstudy. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with\nsupport vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy\nin key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings\nsuggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated\ncode generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable,\nreproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms."}

However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two\ncritical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific\nfeatures, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the\noutput, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic\nalignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,\nresulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original\nsource. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured\nInstruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT\nconsists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the\nsyntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic\nsyntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality\nfine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation\nmodule aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and\ncontrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction\ntuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused\nby the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs\nsyntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend\nstructured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code\ngeneration fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code\nbased on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing\napproaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in\ncode translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion."}
