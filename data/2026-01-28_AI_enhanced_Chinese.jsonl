These tasks often rely on low-level traffic control settings, which require manual setup and technical expertise. This paper presents an automated framework that converts high-level traffic shaping intents in natural or declarative language into valid and correct traffic control rules. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first end-to-end pipeline that ties intent translation in a queuing-theoretic semantic model and, with a rule-based critic, yields deployable Linux traffic control configuration sets. The framework has three steps: (1) a queuing simulation with priority scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) builds a semantic model; (2) a language model, using this semantic model and a traffic profile, generates sub-intents and configuration rules; and (3) a rule-based critic checks and adjusts the rules for correctness and policy compliance. We evaluate multiple language models by generating traffic control commands from business intents that comply with relevant standards for traffic control protocols. Experimental results on 100 intents show significant gains, with LLaMA3 reaching 0.88 semantic similarity and 0.87 semantic coverage, outperforming other models by over 30\\. A thorough sensitivity study demonstrates that AQM-guided prompting reduces variability threefold compared to zero-shot baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6d41\u91cf\u6574\u5f62\u610f\u56fe\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u7684Linux\u6d41\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6392\u961f\u8bba\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u6821\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u914d\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u5230\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u6280\u672f\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u961f\u4eff\u771f\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u518d\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u91cf\u5256\u9762\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u7531\u89c4\u5219\u6821\u9a8c\u5668\u4fee\u6b63\u914d\u7f6e\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u89c4\u3002", "result": "LLaMA3\u5728100\u6761\u610f\u56fe\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea60.88\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u73870.87\uff09\uff0c\u9886\u5148\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u8d8530%\uff1bAQM\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u4f7f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u4e09\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u4e1a\u52a1\u610f\u56fe\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u6d41\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose a complete algorithm-hardware co-design based on flexible metadata, featuring an online quantization with simple encoding. To support the proposed method efficiently, we implement a lightweight hardware unit and integrate it into the accelerator. Evaluation results demonstrate that our method substantially narrows the accuracy gap, achieving on average a 70.63% reduction in accuracy loss compared to MXFP4 and a 37.30% reduction relative to the latest NVFP4 on LLM benchmarks.

In this work, we propose X-Sched, a middleware that uses explainability techniques to generate actionable guidance on resource configurations that makes task execution in containerized environments feasible, under resource and time constraints. X-Sched addresses this gap by integrating counterfactual explanations with advanced machine learning models, such as Random Forests, to efficiently identify optimal configurations.

These false alarms demand substantial manual inspection, creating severe inefficiencies in industrial code review. While recent work has demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) for false alarm reduction on open-source benchmarks, their effectiveness in real-world enterprise settings remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of diverse LLM-based false alarm reduction techniques in an industrial context at Tencent, one of the largest IT companies in China. Using data from Tencent's enterprise-customized SAT on its large-scale Advertising and Marketing Services software, we construct a dataset of 433 alarms (328 false positives, 105 true positives) covering three common bug types. Through interviewing developers and analyzing the data, our results highlight the prevalence of false positives, which wastes substantial manual effort (e.g., 10-20 minutes of manual inspection per alarm). Meanwhile, our results show the huge potential of LLMs for reducing false alarms in industrial settings (e.g., hybrid techniques of LLM and static analysis eliminate 94-98% of false positives with high recall). Furthermore, LLM-based techniques are cost-effective, with per-alarm costs as low as 2.1-109.5 seconds and $0.0011-$0.12, representing orders-of-magnitude savings compared to manual review.

A genome study typically begins with sequencing, which produces millions to billions of short DNA fragments known as reads. Read mapping aligns these reads to a reference genome. Read mapping for short reads comes in two forms: single-end and paired-end, with the latter being more prevalent due to its higher accuracy and support for advanced analysis. Read mapping remains a major performance bottleneck in genome analysis due to expensive dynamic programming. Prior efforts have attempted to mitigate this cost by employing filters to identify and potentially discard computationally expensive matches and leveraging hardware accelerators to speed up the computations. While partially effective, these approaches have limitations. In particular, existing filters are often ineffective for paired-end reads, as they evaluate each read independently and exhibit relatively low filtering ratios. In this work, we propose GenPairX, a hardware-algorithm co-designed accelerator that efficiently minimizes the computational load of paired-end read mapping while enhancing the throughput of memory-intensive operations. GenPairX introduces: (1) a novel filtering algorithm that jointly considers both reads in a pair to improve filtering effectiveness, and a lightweight alignment algorithm to replace most of the computationally expensive dynamic programming operations, and (2) two specialized hardware mechanisms to support the proposed algorithms.

Kubernetes is popular due to its state-centric APIs that decouple the control plane into modular controllers. However, to scale out a burst of FaaS instances, message passing becomes the primary bottleneck as controllers have to exchange extensive state through the API Server. Existing solutions opt for a clean-slate redesign of cluster managers, but at the expense of compatibility with existing ecosystem and substantial engineering effort.\n  We present KUBEDIRECT, a Kubernetes-based cluster manager for FaaS. We find that there exists a common narrow waist across FaaS platform that allows us to achieve both efficiency and external compatibility. Our insight is that the sequential structure of the narrow waist obviates the need for a single source of truth, allowing us to bypass the API Server and perform direct message passing for efficiency. However, our approach introduces a set of ephemeral states across controllers, making it challenging to enforce end-to-end semantics due to the absence of centralized coordination. KUBEDIRECT employs a novel state management scheme that leverages the narrow waist as a hierarchical write-back cache, ensuring consistency and convergence to the desired state. KUBEDIRECT can seamlessly integrate with Kubernetes, adding ~150 LoC per controller.

However, the balanced workload assumption no longer holds in large language model (LLM) post-training due to the high variance in sequence lengths. Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose \\textbf{On-Demand Communication (ODC)}, which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication. Compared to FSDP, ODC reduces the synchronization barrier from once per layer to once per minibatch and decouples the workload on each device so that faster workers are not stalled. It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36\\% speedup over standard FSDP. These results demonstrate that ODC is a superior fit for the prevalent imbalanced workloads in LLM post-training.

In Python, where internal objects are easy to inspect and import, users can come to rely on \"reachable internals\" that were never intended to be public, making refactoring risky and slowing long-term maintenance. This paper revisits the pointer-to-implementation (PIMPL) idiom from C++ and reinterprets it as a Pythonic pattern of opaque delegation: a small public object (or module) that delegates its behavior to a separate implementation object treated as internal. We situate this pattern within a broader taxonomy of encapsulation techniques in Python, relate it to existing practices such as module-level indirection, facade objects, and backend dispatch, and identify PIMPL-like structures already used in the standard library and the scientific Python ecosystem. We then show how a Pythonic PIMPL can be used in existing codebases to isolate heavy dependencies, support lazy imports, and enable runtime selection of alternative backends without changing the public API.

In practice, when developers submit a patch, they often implement the BRT alongside the fix. Our experience deploying agentic APR reveals that developers similarly desire a BRT within AI-generated patches to increase their confidence. However, canonical APR systems tend to generate BRTs and fixes separately, or focus on producing only the fix in the final patch. In this paper, we study agentic APR in the context of cogeneration, where the APR agent is instructed to generate both a fix and a BRT in the same patch. We evaluate the effectiveness of different cogeneration strategies on 120 human-reported bugs at Google and characterize different cogeneration strategies by their influence on APR agent behavior. We develop and evaluate patch selectors that account for test change information to select patches with plausible fixes (and plausible BRTs). Finally, we analyze the root causes of failed cogeneration trajectories. Importantly, we show that cogeneration allows the APR agent to generate BRTs for at least as many bugs as a dedicated BRT agent, without compromising the generation rate of plausible fixes, thereby reducing engineering effort in maintaining and coordinating separate generation pipelines for fix and BRT at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6210\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u91cd\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6548\u679c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u5f00\u9500\u3002", " vibra": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e0c\u671bAI\u751f\u6210\u8865\u4e01\u65f6\u5305\u542b\u9519\u8bef\u91cd\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u5206\u79bb\u751f\u6210\u6216\u4ec5\u751f\u6210\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u672a\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u534f\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u5728120\u4e2aGoogle\u62a5\u544a\u7684bug\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8003\u8651\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d8\u66f4\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u683c\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u534f\u540c\u4f34\u5931\u8d25\u4e3b\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u534f\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4e3a\u540c\u91cfbug\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u91cd\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4fee\u590d\u751f\u6210\u7387\u4e0d\u53d7\u635f\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u4fee\u590d\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5355\u72ec\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u534f\u8c03\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u7a0b\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4fee\u590d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable"}}

In this work, we design HalluJudge that aims to assess the grounding of generated review comments based on the context alignment. HalluJudge includes four key strategies ranging from direct assessment to structured multi-branch reasoning (e.g., Tree-of-Thoughts). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these assessment strategies across Atlassian's enterprise-scale software projects to examine the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of HalluJudge. Furthermore, we analyze the alignment between HalluJudge's judgment and developer preference of the actual LLM-generated code review comments in the real-world production. Our results show that the hallucination assessment in HalluJudge is cost-effective with an F1 score of 0.85 and an average cost of $0.009. On average, 67% of the HalluJudge assessments are aligned with the developer preference of the actual LLM-generated review comments in the online production.

We propose a mutation testing technique that utilizes a hybrid of static and dynamic analyses to mutate Python programs based on these operators while minimizing equivalent mutants.

Our results show that PyTation generates mutants that complement those from general-purpose tools, exhibiting distinct behaviour under test execution and uncovering inadequacies in high-coverage test suites.

CI services offer caching mechanisms to speed up builds by reusing infrequently changing artifacts, yet little is known about how caching is adopted in practice and what challenges it entails. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of CI caching in Travis CI, analyzing 513,384 builds from 1,279 GitHub projects. We find that only 30% of projects adopt CI caching, and early adoption is strongly associated with project maturity, such as more dependencies, more commits, and longer CI lifespans. To understand why many projects do not adopt caching, we submitted pull requests enabling caching in non-adopting projects, and nearly half were accepted or merged. Developer feedback suggests that non- or late adoption mainly stems from limited awareness of CI caching support. We also examine cache maintenance and identify five common activities, performed by 24% of cache-enabled projects. Although one-third of projects see substantial build-time reductions, cache uploads occur in 97% of builds, and 33% of projects contain stale cached artifacts. Finally, our analysis of reported caching issues shows developers mainly struggle with corrupted or outdated caches or request broader caching features. Overall, CI caching does not help all projects, needs ongoing maintenance, and is more complex in practice than many developers expect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790CI\u7f13\u5b58\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff1a\u4ec530%\u9879\u76ee\u542f\u7528\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0e\u9879\u76ee\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u610f\u8bc6\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u7f13\u5b58\u7ef4\u62a4\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u5e38\u51fa\u9519\u3002", "motivation": "CI\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u5f71\u54cdammed\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7f13\u5b58\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u4f46\u91c7\u7528\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u6311\u6218\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u9700\u63ed\u793a\u5b9e\u8df5\u969c\u788d", "method": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76Travis CI\uff0c\u5206\u6790513,384\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u548c1,279\u4e2aGitHub\u9879\u76ee\uff1b\u63d0\u4ea4\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u5230\u975e\u91c7\u7528\u9879\u76ee\u5e76\u6536\u96c6\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u53cd\u9988", "result": "30%\u9879\u76ee\u542f\u7528\u7f13\u5b58\u4e14\u65e9\u671f\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u9879\u76ee\u6210\u719f\u5ea6(\u5982\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u3001\u63d0\u4ea4\u91cf)\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b47%\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u88ab\u63a5\u53d7\u8868\u660e\u610f\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e3a\u9996\u56e0\uff1b24%\u9879\u76ee\u8fdb\u884c\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c97%\u6784\u5efa\u4f1a\u4e0a\u4f20\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c33%\u5b58\u5728\u9648\u65e7\u7f13\u5b58", "conclusion": "CI\u7f13\u5b58\u975e\u4e07\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8d85\u9884\u671f"}}

Our evaluation yields three key findings: First, while LLM-based detectors exhibit low recall on the in-house benchmark, they still uncover more unique vulnerabilities than traditional tools. Second, in open-source projects, both LLM-based and traditional tools generate substantial warnings but suffer from very high false discovery rates, hindering practical use. Our manual analysis further reveals shallow interprocedural reasoning and misidentified source/sink pairs as primary failure causes, with LLM-based tools exhibiting additional unique failures. Finally, LLM-based methods incurs substantial computational costs-hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of tokens and multi-hour to multi-day runtimes. Overall, our findings underscore critical limitations in the robustness, reliability, and scalability of current LLM-based detectors.

While this accelerates software development and supports learning, it also raises new risks for academic integrity, authorship attribution, and responsible AI use. This paper investigates the problem of distinguishing human-written from machine-generated code by comparing two complementary approaches: feature-based detectors built from lightweight, interpretable stylometric and structural properties of code, and embedding-based detectors leveraging pretrained code encoders. Using a recent large-scale benchmark dataset of 600k human-written and AI-generated code samples, we find that feature-based models achieve strong performance (ROC-AUC 0.995, PR-AUC 0.995, F1 0.971), while embedding-based models with CodeBERT embeddings are also very competitive (ROC-AUC 0.994, PR-AUC 0.994, F1 0.965). Analysis shows that features tied to indentation and whitespace provide particularly discriminative cues, whereas embeddings capture deeper semantic patterns and yield slightly higher precision. These findings underscore the trade-offs between interpretability and generalization, offering practical guidance for deploying robust code-origin detection in academic and industrial contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684CodeBERT\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u5199\u4e0eAI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0646\u064a\u0646": " steward\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u4f5c\u8005\u5f52\u5c5e\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u4f7f\u7528\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752860\u4e07\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u7f29\u8fdb\u7b49\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u548cCodeBERT\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6301\u5f81\u6a21\u578bROC-AUC 0.995\ud558\uba74 PR-AUC 0.995\ud558\uba74 F1 0.971\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578bROC-AUC 0.994\u1cdd PR-AUC 0.994\u1cdd F1 0.965\uff1b\u7f29\u8fdb\u548c\u7a7a\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u6700\u5177\u533a\u5206\u529b\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u6355\u83b7\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7a0d\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u90e8\u7f72\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u6e90\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable"}}

The design and evaluation of these strategies are critical, as they directly influence the generalizability of research findings. However, sampling remains an underestimated aspect in software engineering research: we identify two main challenges related to (1) the design and representativeness of sampling approaches, and (2) the ability to reason about the implications of sampling decisions on generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to explicitly describe complex sampling strategies through composable sampling operators. This formalism supports both the specification and the reasoning about the generalizability of results based on the applied sampling strategies. We implement the DSL as a Python-based fluent API, and demonstrate how it facilitates representativeness reasoning using statistical indicators extracted from sampling workflows. We validate our approach through a case study of MSR papers involving code repository sampling.

To address this, recent studies have applied natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to classify comments according to developers' intentions. However, existing datasets for this task suffer from size limitations and class imbalance, as they rely on manual annotations and may not accurately represent the distribution of comments in real-world codebases.

The final version appears in ACM CHASE 2026", "summary": "As GenAI models are adopted to support software engineers and their development teams, understanding effective human-AI collaboration (HAIC) is increasingly important. Socio-emotional intelligence (SEI) enhances collaboration among human teammates, but its role in HAIC remains unclear. Current AI systems lack SEI capabilities that humans bring to teamwork, creating a potential gap in collaborative dynamics. In this study, we investigate how software practitioners perceive the socio-emotional gap in HAIC and what capabilities AI systems require for effective collaboration. Through semi-structured interviews with 10 practitioners, we examine how they think about collaborating with human versus AI teammates, focusing on their SEI expectations and the AI capabilities they envision. Results indicate that practitioners currently view AI models as intellectual teammates rather than social partners and expect fewer SEI attributes from them than from human teammates. However, they see the socio-emotional gap not as AIs failure to exhibit SEI traits, but as a functional gap in collaborative capabilities (AIs inability to negotiate responsibilities, adapt contextually, or maintain sustained partnerships). We introduce the concept of functional equivalents: technical capabilities (internal cognition, contextual intelligence, adaptive learning, and collaborative intelligence) that achieve collaborative outcomes comparable to human SEI attributes. Our findings suggest that effective collaboration with AI for SE tasks may benefit from functional design rather than replicating human SEI traits for SE tasks, thereby redefining collaboration as functional alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u4e0eGenAI\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u89c6AI\u4e3a\u667a\u529b\u961f\u53cb\u800c\u975e\u793e\u4ea4\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u901a\u8fc7\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u975e\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f84\u6e05AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8fa8\u8bc6\u5f53\u524d\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5bf910\u540d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u4eba\u53caAI\u961f\u53cb\u5408\u4f5c\u65f6\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u671f\u671b\u4e0eAI\u80fd\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3aAI\u5408\u4f5c\u5b58\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u7f3a\u53e3\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u6cd5\u534f\u5546\u8d23\u4efb\u6216\u9002\u5e94\u60c5\u5883\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u7b49\u6548\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u5185\u90e8\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u534f\u4f5c\u6210\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u5408\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u80fd\u3002"}}

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches have shown promise by retrieving relevant code snippets as cross-file context, they suffer from two fundamental problems: misalignment between the query and the target code in the retrieval process, and the inability of existing retrieval methods to effectively utilize the inference information. To address these challenges, we propose AlignCoder, a repository-level code completion framework that introduces a query enhancement mechanism and a reinforcement learning based retriever training method. Our approach generates multiple candidate completions to construct an enhanced query that bridges the semantic gap between the initial query and the target code. Additionally, we employ reinforcement learning to train an AlignRetriever that learns to leverage inference information in the enhanced query for more accurate retrieval. We evaluate AlignCoder on two widely-used benchmarks (CrossCodeEval and RepoEval) across five backbone code LLMs, demonstrating an 18.1% improvement in EM score compared to baselines on the CrossCodeEval benchmark.

However, the lack of large-scale curated datasets limits research on their quality and reliability. This paper presents TOFU-D, a snapshot of 1,788 Dialogflow chatbots from GitHub, and COD, a curated subset of TOFU-D including 185 validated chatbots. The two datasets capture a wide range of domains, languages, and implementation patterns, offering a sound basis for empirical studies on chatbot quality and security. A preliminary assessment using the Botium testing framework and the Bandit static analyzer revealed gaps in test coverage and frequent security vulnerabilities in several chatbots, highlighting the need for systematic, multi-Platform research on chatbot quality and security.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86TOFU-D\u548cCOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u578b\u7cbe\u9009\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u610f\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaTOFU-D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff081788\u4e2aDialogflow\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u793a\u4f8b\uff09\u548cCOD\u7cbe\u9009\u5b50\u96c6\uff08185\u4e2a\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u793a\u4f8b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Botium\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u548cBandit\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728 reunion\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728 gaps \u5e76\u9891\u7e41\u51fa\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d1\u73b0\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u3001\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}
