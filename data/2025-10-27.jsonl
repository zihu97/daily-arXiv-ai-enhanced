Drawing on\nrecent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems\nqualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated\nreliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the\nview that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's\nindependent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism\n- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic\nbases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing\nauthority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a\nmore promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to\nthis view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than\noutright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This\napproach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by\nkeeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful\nhuman oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI\nwhen reliability conditions are unmet.

In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,\na novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG\nguided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method\nfirst identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly\ncorrelates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic\nalgorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.\nCrucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned\nRAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful\nexternal knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,\nPoison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge\nconflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate\nconsistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over\n90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method\neffectively resolves knowledge conflict."}

However, SFT,\nbeing an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with\noverfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel\nfine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance\ngeneralization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and\nproximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from\ndemonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy\nratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves\nas an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the\nSFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without\nrelying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding\nmechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,\ndata efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of\nnatural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO\nconsistently outperforms traditional SFT methods.

We begin by\ndefining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the\nfactors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection\nchallenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used\nthroughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the\nlifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments.

Some specific NLP\nmodels have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to\nsuch distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design.

Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to\nshed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We\nhypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively\nfew English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words\ntend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In\nour analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word\ncollapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to\ndisambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by\ncomparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic\nWikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by\nscrambling is smaller than expected."}

CAMV\nreformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted\nfalsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among\nexpert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification\ncost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.\nTRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents\nthrough a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and\nauditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,\nsource-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout\nthe reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,\nwhere TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or\nreinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,\nCo-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last\nExam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%).

To ground visual concepts along\nthe discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which\nensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting\nothers.

To address these limitations, we decouple video\ninpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and\nmasked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that\nintroduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with\nspatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module\nto perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame\ncontent into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.\nAdditionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes\ncoherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the\nI2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during\ngeneration. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves\ncompetitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,\nits design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion\nstability, outperforming existing approaches."}

As a result, doctors and nurses can access\nreal-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting\nwith an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for\nreal-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals\nand healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities\nof the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness\nof its various capabilities."}
