Although\nhigh-performing verifiers can detect reasoning errors, making them reliable\nrequires substantial training. To address these challenges, we introduce a\nnovel inference-time framework, Adaptive Coopetition (AdCo), in which LLM\nagents utilize an adaptive, UCB-based \"coopetition\" mechanism.

Performance benchmarks, however,\nare resource-intensive and time-consuming, which is a major challenge for\nintegration into Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)\npipelines. Although numerous benchmark optimization techniques have been\nproposed to accelerate benchmark execution, there is currently no practical\nsystem that integrates these optimizations seamlessly into real-world CI/CD\npipelines. In this vision paper, we argue that the field of benchmark\noptimization remains under-explored in key areas that hinder its broader\nadoption. We identify three central challenges to enabling frequent and\nefficient benchmarking: (a) the composability of benchmark optimization\nstrategies, (b) automated evaluation of benchmarking results, and (c) the\nusability and complexity of applying these strategies as part of CI/CD systems\nin practice. We also introduce a conceptual cloud-based benchmarking framework\nhandling these challenges transparently. By presenting these open problems, we\naim to stimulate research toward making performance regression detection in\nCI/CD systems more practical and effective."}

While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative\nrepresentations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for\nquantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory\noffers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical\nreport bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize\ntwo critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We\nground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating\ndepender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence\ncoefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize\ncomplementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept,\nmodeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We\nintegrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation\nand introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates\nstructural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental\ntesting across power and logarithmic value function specifications,\ndemonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the\nSamsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications\nachieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions\nprovide theoretical tractability. This technical report serves as the\nfoundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic\ncoopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with companion\nwork addressing trust dynamics, team production, and reciprocity mechanisms."}
