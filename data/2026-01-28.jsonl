These tasks often rely on low-level traffic control settings, which require manual setup and technical expertise. This paper presents an automated framework that converts high-level traffic shaping intents in natural or declarative language into valid and correct traffic control rules. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first end-to-end pipeline that ties intent translation in a queuing-theoretic semantic model and, with a rule-based critic, yields deployable Linux traffic control configuration sets. The framework has three steps: (1) a queuing simulation with priority scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) builds a semantic model; (2) a language model, using this semantic model and a traffic profile, generates sub-intents and configuration rules; and (3) a rule-based critic checks and adjusts the rules for correctness and policy compliance. We evaluate multiple language models by generating traffic control commands from business intents that comply with relevant standards for traffic control protocols. Experimental results on 100 intents show significant gains, with LLaMA3 reaching 0.88 semantic similarity and 0.87 semantic coverage, outperforming other models by over 30\\. A thorough sensitivity study demonstrates that AQM-guided prompting reduces variability threefold compared to zero-shot baselines."}

Since they interact with users without supervision, they must be tested extensively. Current testing approaches focus on acceptance-level evaluation from the user's perspective.

In this paper, we present methods to enable structural testing of LLM-based agents. Our approach utilizes traces (based on OpenTelemetry) to capture agent trajectories, employs mocking to enforce reproducible LLM behavior, and adds assertions to automate test verification. This enables testing agent components and interactions at a deeper technical level within automated workflows. We demonstrate how structural testing enables the adaptation of software engineering best practices to agents, including the test automation pyramid, regression testing, test-driven development, and multi-language testing. In representative case studies, we demonstrate automated execution and faster root-cause analysis. Collectively, these methods reduce testing costs and improve agent quality through higher coverage, reusability, and earlier defect detection.

This paper proposes a resource-centric definition of efficiency, isolating the hardware cost required to maintain a non-blocking throughput constraint.

We conclude that while high-radix direct networks optimize efficiency at small to medium scales, indirect networks (e.g., Fat Trees) are required to cap router complexity at massive scales.

While central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) have traditionally served as the primary inference engines, their general-purpose nature often leads to inefficiencies under strict latency or power budgets. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer a promising alternative by enabling custom-tailored parallelism and hardware-level optimizations. However, mapping AI workloads to FPGAs remains challenging due to the complexity of hardware-software co-design and data orchestration. This paper presents AI FPGA Agent, an agent-driven framework that simplifies the integration and acceleration of deep neural network inference on FPGAs. The proposed system employs a runtime software agent that dynamically partitions AI models, schedules compute-intensive layers for hardware offload, and manages data transfers with minimal developer intervention. The hardware component includes a parameterizable accelerator core optimized for high-throughput inference using quantized arithmetic. Experimental results demonstrate that the AI FPGA Agent achieves over 10x latency reduction compared to CPU baselines and 2-3x higher energy efficiency than GPU implementations, all while preserving classification accuracy within 0.2% of full-precision references. These findings underscore the potential of AI-FPGA co-design for scalable, energy-efficient AI deployment."}

These false alarms demand substantial manual inspection, creating severe inefficiencies in industrial code review. While recent work has demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) for false alarm reduction on open-source benchmarks, their effectiveness in real-world enterprise settings remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of diverse LLM-based false alarm reduction techniques in an industrial context at Tencent, one of the largest IT companies in China. Using data from Tencent's enterprise-customized SAT on its large-scale Advertising and Marketing Services software, we construct a dataset of 433 alarms (328 false positives, 105 true positives) covering three common bug types. Through interviewing developers and analyzing the data, our results highlight the prevalence of false positives, which wastes substantial manual effort (e.g., 10-20 minutes of manual inspection per alarm). Meanwhile, our results show the huge potential of LLMs for reducing false alarms in industrial settings (e.g., hybrid techniques of LLM and static analysis eliminate 94-98% of false positives with high recall). Furthermore, LLM-based techniques are cost-effective, with per-alarm costs as low as 2.1-109.5 seconds and $0.0011-$0.12, representing orders-of-magnitude savings compared to manual review. Finally, our case analysis further identifies key limitations of LLM-based false alarm reduction in industrial settings."}

A genome study typically begins with sequencing, which produces millions to billions of short DNA fragments known as reads. Read mapping aligns these reads to a reference genome. Read mapping for short reads comes in two forms: single-end and paired-end, with the latter being more prevalent due to its higher accuracy and support for advanced analysis. Read mapping remains a major performance bottleneck in genome analysis due to expensive dynamic programming. Prior efforts have attempted to mitigate this cost by employing filters to identify and potentially discard computationally expensive matches and leveraging hardware accelerators to speed up the computations. While partially effective, these approaches have limitations. In particular, existing filters are often ineffective for paired-end reads, as they evaluate each read independently and exhibit relatively low filtering ratios. In this work, we propose GenPairX, a hardware-algorithm co-designed accelerator that efficiently minimizes the computational load of paired-end read mapping while enhancing the throughput of memory-intensive operations. GenPairX introduces: (1) a novel filtering algorithm that jointly considers both reads in a pair to improve filtering effectiveness, and a lightweight alignment algorithm to replace most of the computationally expensive dynamic programming operations, and (2) two specialized hardware mechanisms to support the proposed algorithms. Our evaluations show that GenPairX delivers substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art solutions, achieving 1575x and 1.43x higher throughput per watt compared to leading CPU-based and accelerator-based read mappers, respectively, all without compromising accuracy."}

Kubernetes is popular due to its state-centric APIs that decouple the control plane into modular controllers. However, to scale out a burst of FaaS instances, message passing becomes the primary bottleneck as controllers have to exchange extensive state through the API Server. Existing solutions opt for a clean-slate redesign of cluster managers, but at the expense of compatibility with existing ecosystem and substantial engineering effort.\n  We present KUBEDIRECT, a Kubernetes-based cluster manager for FaaS. We find that there exists a common narrow waist across FaaS platform that allows us to achieve both efficiency and external compatibility. Our insight is that the sequential structure of the narrow waist obviates the need for a single source of truth, allowing us to bypass the API Server and perform direct message passing for efficiency. However, our approach introduces a set of ephemeral states across controllers, making it challenging to enforce end-to-end semantics due to the absence of centralized coordination. KUBEDIRECT employs a novel state management scheme that leverages the narrow waist as a hierarchical write-back cache, ensuring consistency and convergence to the desired state. KUBEDIRECT can seamlessly integrate with Kubernetes, adding ~150 LoC per controller. Experiments show that KUBEDIRECT reduces serving latency by 26.7x over Knative, and has similar performance as the state-of-the-art clean-slate platform Dirigent."}

However, the balanced workload assumption no longer holds in large language model (LLM) post-training due to the high variance in sequence lengths. Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose \\textbf{On-Demand Communication (ODC)}, which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication. Compared to FSDP, ODC reduces the synchronization barrier from once per layer to once per minibatch and decouples the workload on each device so that faster workers are not stalled. It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36\\% speedup over standard FSDP. These results demonstrate that ODC is a superior fit for the prevalent imbalanced workloads in LLM post-training.

To bridge this gap, we propose a microservice-based FM inference framework that exploits the intrinsic functional asymmetry between heavyweight core services and agile light services. Our two-tier deployment strategy ensures robust Quality of Service (QoS) under resource contention. Specifically, core services are placed statically via a long-term network-aware integer program with sparsity constraints to form a fault-tolerant backbone. On the other hand, light services are orchestrated dynamically by a low-complexity online controller that integrates effective capacity theory with Lyapunov optimization, providing probabilistic latency guarantees under real-time workload fluctuations. Simulations demonstrate that our framework achieves over 84% average on-time task completion with moderate deployment costs and maintains strong robustness as the system load scales."}

Existing SLO-aware approaches require RAN--edge coordination, making them impractical for deployment and prone to poor performance due to coordination delays, limited heterogeneous application support, and ignoring edge resource contention. This paper introduces SMEC, a practical, SLO-aware resource management framework that facilitates deadline-aware scheduling through fully decoupled operations at the RAN and edge servers. Our key insight is that standard 5G protocols and application behaviors naturally provide information exploitable for SLO-aware management without extensive infrastructure or application changes. Evaluation on our 5G MEC testbed shows that SMEC achieves 90-96% SLO satisfaction versus under 6% for existing approaches, while reducing tail latency by up to 122$\\times$.

In Python, where internal objects are easy to inspect and import, users can come to rely on \"reachable internals\" that were never intended to be public, making refactoring risky and slowing long-term maintenance. This paper revisits the pointer-to-implementation (PIMPL) idiom from C++ and reinterprets it as a Pythonic pattern of opaque delegation: a small public object (or module) that delegates its behavior to a separate implementation object treated as internal. We situate this pattern within a broader taxonomy of encapsulation techniques in Python, relate it to existing practices such as module-level indirection, facade objects, and backend dispatch, and identify PIMPL-like structures already used in the standard library and the scientific Python ecosystem. We then show how a Pythonic PIMPL can be used in existing codebases to isolate heavy dependencies, support lazy imports, and enable runtime selection of alternative backends without changing the public API. Finally, we discuss the benefits and trade-offs of the approach and offer practical guidance on when the pattern is appropriate and how to apply it in large, long-lived Python libraries."}

However, constructing accurate 3D radio maps requires fine-grained 3D geometric information and a profound understanding of electromagnetic wave propagation. Existing approaches typically treat optical and wireless knowledge as distinct modalities, failing to exploit the fundamental physical principles governing both light and electromagnetic propagation. To bridge this gap, we propose URF-GS, a unified radio-optical radiation field representation framework for accurate and generalizable 3D radio map construction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) and inverse rendering. By fusing visual and wireless sensing observations, URF-GS recovers scene geometry and material properties while accurately predicting radio signal behavior at arbitrary transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that URF-GS achieves up to a 24.7% improvement in spatial spectrum prediction accuracy and a 10x increase in sample efficiency for 3D radio map construction compared with neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods.

In practice, when developers submit a patch, they often implement the BRT alongside the fix. Our experience deploying agentic APR reveals that developers similarly desire a BRT within AI-generated patches to increase their confidence. However, canonical APR systems tend to generate BRTs and fixes separately, or focus on producing only the fix in the final patch. In this paper, we study agentic APR in the context of cogeneration, where the APR agent is instructed to generate both a fix and a BRT in the same patch. We evaluate the effectiveness of different cogeneration strategies on 120 human-reported bugs at Google and characterize different cogeneration strategies by their influence on APR agent behavior. We develop and evaluate patch selectors that account for test change information to select patches with plausible fixes (and plausible BRTs). Finally, we analyze the root causes of failed cogeneration trajectories. Importantly, we show that cogeneration allows the APR agent to generate BRTs for at least as many bugs as a dedicated BRT agent, without compromising the generation rate of plausible fixes, thereby reducing engineering effort in maintaining and coordinating separate generation pipelines for fix and BRT at scale."}

To address this, we explore effective and scalable methods for a hallucination detection in LLM-generated code review comments without the reference. In this work, we design HalluJudge that aims to assess the grounding of generated review comments based on the context alignment. HalluJudge includes four key strategies ranging from direct assessment to structured multi-branch reasoning (e.g., Tree-of-Thoughts). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these assessment strategies across Atlassian's enterprise-scale software projects to examine the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of HalluJudge. Furthermore, we analyze the alignment between HalluJudge's judgment and developer preference of the actual LLM-generated code review comments in the real-world production. Our results show that the hallucination assessment in HalluJudge is cost-effective with an F1 score of 0.85 and an average cost of $0.009. On average, 67% of the HalluJudge assessments are aligned with the developer preference of the actual LLM-generated review comments in the online production.

Existing topology control methods rely on global optimization to produce a single optimal topology or involve high computational complexity, which limits adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper presents a two-stage quantum-assisted framework for efficient and resilient topology control in dynamic UAV networks by exploiting quantum parallelism to generate a set of high-quality and structurally diverse candidate topologies. In the offline stage, we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and leverage quantum annealing (QA) to parallelly sample multiple high-quality and structurally distinct topologies, providing a rich solution space for adaptive decision-making. In the online stage, a lightweight classical selection mechanism rapidly identifies the most suitable topology based on real-time link stability and channel conditions, substantially reducing the computation delay. The simulation results show that, compared to a single static optimal topology, the proposed framework improves performance retention by 6.6% in a 30-second dynamic window. Moreover, relative to the classic method, QA achieves an additional 5.15% reduction in objective value and a 28.3% increase in solution diversity. These findings demonstrate the potential of QA to enable fast and robust topology control for next-generation UAV communication networks."}

We propose a mutation testing technique that utilizes a hybrid of static and dynamic analyses to mutate Python programs based on these operators while minimizing equivalent mutants. We implement our approach in a tool called PyTation and evaluate it on 13 open-source Python applications. Our results show that PyTation generates mutants that complement those from general-purpose tools, exhibiting distinct behaviour under test execution and uncovering inadequacies in high-coverage test suites. We further demonstrate that PyTation produces a high proportion of unique mutants, a low cross-kill rate, and a low test overlap ratio relative to baseline tools, highlighting its novel fault model. PyTation also incurs few equivalent mutants, aided by dynamic analysis heuristics."}

These tasks include code generation, summarization, understanding, repair, testing, and optimization. This trend is growing faster with large language models and autonomous agents. A key challenge is how to design reward signals that make sense for software. In many RL problems, the reward is a clear number. In software, this is often not possible. The goal is rarely a single numeric objective. Instead, rewards are usually proxies. Common proxies check if the code compiles, passes tests, or satisfies quality metrics. Many reward designs have been proposed for code-related tasks. However, the work is scattered across areas and papers. There is no single survey that brings these approaches together and shows the full landscape of reward design for RL in software. In this survey, we provide the first systematic and comprehensive review of reward engineering for RL in software tasks. We focus on existing methods and techniques. We structure the literature along three complementary dimensions, summarizing the reward-design choices within each. We conclude with challenges and recommendations in the reward design space for SE tasks."}

CI services offer caching mechanisms to speed up builds by reusing infrequently changing artifacts, yet little is known about how caching is adopted in practice and what challenges it entails. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of CI caching in Travis CI, analyzing 513,384 builds from 1,279 GitHub projects. We find that only 30% of projects adopt CI caching, and early adoption is strongly associated with project maturity, such as more dependencies, more commits, and longer CI lifespans. To understand why many projects do not adopt caching, we submitted pull requests enabling caching in non-adopting projects, and nearly half were accepted or merged. Developer feedback suggests that non- or late adoption mainly stems from limited awareness of CI caching support. We also examine cache maintenance and identify five common activities, performed by 24% of cache-enabled projects. Although one-third of projects see substantial build-time reductions, cache uploads occur in 97% of builds, and 33% of projects contain stale cached artifacts. Finally, our analysis of reported caching issues shows developers mainly struggle with corrupted or outdated caches or request broader caching features. Overall, CI caching does not help all projects, needs ongoing maintenance, and is more complex in practice than many developers expect."}

Our evaluation yields three key findings: First, while LLM-based detectors exhibit low recall on the in-house benchmark, they still uncover more unique vulnerabilities than traditional tools. Second, in open-source projects, both LLM-based and traditional tools generate substantial warnings but suffer from very high false discovery rates, hindering practical use. Our manual analysis further reveals shallow interprocedural reasoning and misidentified source/sink pairs as primary failure causes, with LLM-based tools exhibiting additional unique failures. Finally, LLM-based methods incurs substantial computational costs-hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of tokens and multi-hour to multi-day runtimes. Overall, our findings underscore critical limitations in the robustness, reliability, and scalability of current LLM-based detectors.

Using a recent large-scale benchmark dataset of 600k human-written and AI-generated code samples, we find that feature-based models achieve strong performance (ROC-AUC 0.995, PR-AUC 0.995, F1 0.971), while embedding-based models with CodeBERT embeddings are also very competitive (ROC-AUC 0.994, PR-AUC 0.994, F1 0.965).

Using a curated subset of the AIDev dataset, we analyze 19,450 inline review comments spanning 3,177 agent-authored PRs from real-world GitHub repositories. We first derive a taxonomy of 12 review comment themes using topic modeling combined with large language model (LLM)-assisted semantic clustering and consolidation. According to this taxonomy, we then investigate whether zero-shot prompts to LLM can reliably annotate review comments. Our evaluation against human annotations shows that open-source LLM achieves reasonably high exact match (78.63%), macro F1 score (0.78), and substantial agreement with human annotators at the review comment level. At the PR level, the LLM also correctly identifies the dominant review theme with 78% Top-1 accuracy and achieves an average Jaccard similarity of 0.76, indicating strong alignment with human judgments. Applying this annotation pipeline at scale, we find that apart from functional correctness and logical changes, reviews of agent-authored PRs predominantly focus on documentation gaps, refactoring needs, styling and formatting issues, with testing and security-related concerns.

To address these challenges, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to explicitly describe complex sampling strategies through composable sampling operators. This formalism supports both the specification and the reasoning about the generalizability of results based on the applied sampling strategies. We implement the DSL as a Python-based fluent API, and demonstrate how it facilitates representativeness reasoning using statistical indicators extracted from sampling workflows. We validate our approach through a case study of MSR papers involving code repository sampling. Our results show that the DSL can model the sampling strategies reported in recent literature."}

The final version appears in ACM CHASE 2026", "summary": "As GenAI models are adopted to support software engineers and their development teams, understanding effective human-AI collaboration (HAIC) is increasingly important. Socio-emotional intelligence (SEI) enhances collaboration among human teammates, but its role in HAIC remains unclear. Current AI systems lack SEI capabilities that humans bring to teamwork, creating a potential gap in collaborative dynamics. In this study, we investigate how software practitioners perceive the socio-emotional gap in HAIC and what capabilities AI systems require for effective collaboration. Through semi-structured interviews with 10 practitioners, we examine how they think about collaborating with human versus AI teammates, focusing on their SEI expectations and the AI capabilities they envision. Results indicate that practitioners currently view AI models as intellectual teammates rather than social partners and expect fewer SEI attributes from them than from human teammates. However, they see the socio-emotional gap not as AIs failure to exhibit SEI traits, but as a functional gap in collaborative capabilities (AIs inability to negotiate responsibilities, adapt contextually, or maintain sustained partnerships). We introduce the concept of functional equivalents: technical capabilities (internal cognition, contextual intelligence, adaptive learning, and collaborative intelligence) that achieve collaborative outcomes comparable to human SEI attributes. Our findings suggest that effective collaboration with AI for SE tasks may benefit from functional design rather than replicating human SEI traits for SE tasks, thereby redefining collaboration as functional alignment."}

However, existing benchmarks suffer from two critical limitations: first, the lack of multi-language support in repository-level contexts, which restricts the generalizability of evaluation results; second, the reliance on noisy, incomplete ground truth derived from raw Pull Request (PR) comments, which constrains the scope of issue detection. To address these challenges, we introduce AACR-Bench a comprehensive benchmark that provides full cross-file context across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional datasets, AACR-Bench employs an \"AI-assisted, Expert-verified\" annotation pipeline to uncover latent defects often overlooked in original PRs, resulting in a 285\\% increase in defect coverage. Extensive evaluations of mainstream LLMs on AACR-Bench reveal that previous assessments may have either misjudged or only partially captured model capabilities due to data limitations. Our work establishes a more rigorous standard for ACR evaluation and offers new insights on LLM based ACR, i.e., the granularity/level of context and the choice of retrieval methods significantly impact ACR performance, and this influence varies depending on the LLM, programming language, and the LLM usage paradigm e.g., whether an Agent architecture is employed.

The architectural knowledge is distributed across heterogeneous software artifacts such as requirements documents, design diagrams, code, and documentation, making it difficult for developers to access and utilize this knowledge effectively. Moreover, as systems evolve, inconsistencies frequently emerge between these artifacts, leading to architectural erosion and impeding maintenance activities. We envision an automated pipeline that systematically extracts architectural knowledge from diverse artifacts, links them, identifies and resolves inconsistencies, and consolidates this knowledge into a structured knowledge base. This knowledge base enables critical activities such as architecture conformance checking and change impact analysis, while supporting natural language question-answering to improve access to architectural knowledge. To realize this vision, we plan to develop specialized extractors for different artifact types, design a unified knowledge representation schema, implement consistency checking mechanisms, and integrate retrieval-augmented generation techniques for conversational knowledge access."}

While these developments promise efficiency, they also raise concerns about skill degradation, responsibility, and trust in scholarly outputs. This vision paper employs Design Fiction as a methodological lens to examine how such concerns might materialise if current practices persist. Drawing on themes reported in a recent community survey, we construct a speculative artifact situated in a near future research setting. The fiction is used as an analytical device rather than a forecast, enabling reflection on how automated assistance might impede domain knowledge competence, verification, and mentoring practices. By presenting an intentionally unsettling scenario, the paper invites discussion on how the software engineering research community in the future will define proficiency, allocate responsibility, and support learning."}

This paper compares vulnerability ID use in GitHub pull requests authored by autonomous agents, bots, and human developers. Using the AIDev pop dataset and an augmented set of pull requests from the same repositories, we analyse who mentions vulnerability identifiers and where they appear. Bots account for around 69.1% of all mentions, usually adding few identifiers in pull request descriptions, while human and agent mentions are rarer but span more locations. Qualitative analysis shows that bots mainly reference identifiers in automated dependency updates and audits, whereas humans and agents use them to support fixes, maintenance, and discussion."}

However, it is often unclear how much benefit LLMs really provide. We concentrate on software architects and investigated how an LLM-supported evaluation of architecture documents can support software architects to improve such artefacts. In the context of a research project where a digital marketplace is developed and digital solutions should be analyzed, we used different LLMs to analyze the quality of architecture documents and compared the results with evaluations from software architects. We found out that the quality of the artifact has a strong influence on the quality of the LLM, i.e., the better the quality of the architecture document was, the more consistent were the LLM-based evaluation and the human expert evaluation. While using LLMs in this architecture task is promising, our results showed inconsistencies that need further analyses before generalizing them."}

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches have shown promise by retrieving relevant code snippets as cross-file context, they suffer from two fundamental problems: misalignment between the query and the target code in the retrieval process, and the inability of existing retrieval methods to effectively utilize the inference information. To address these challenges, we propose AlignCoder, a repository-level code completion framework that introduces a query enhancement mechanism and a reinforcement learning based retriever training method. Our approach generates multiple candidate completions to construct an enhanced query that bridges the semantic gap between the initial query and the target code. Additionally, we employ reinforcement learning to train an AlignRetriever that learns to leverage inference information in the enhanced query for more accurate retrieval. We evaluate AlignCoder on two widely-used benchmarks (CrossCodeEval and RepoEval) across five backbone code LLMs, demonstrating an 18.1% improvement in EM score compared to baselines on the CrossCodeEval benchmark. The results show that our framework achieves superior performance and exhibits high generalizability across various code LLMs and programming languages."}

However, silicon-grade correctness remains bottlenecked by: (i) limited test coverage and reliability of simulation-centric evaluation, (ii) regressions and repair hallucinations introduced by iterative debugging, and (iii) semantic drift as intent is reinterpreted across agent handoffs. In this work, we propose Veri-Sure, a multi-agent framework that establishes a design contract to align agents' intent and uses a patching mechanism guided by static dependency slicing to perform precise, localized repairs. By integrating a multi-branch verification pipeline that combines trace-driven temporal analysis with formal verification consisting of assertion-based checking and boolean equivalence proofs, Veri-Sure enables functional correctness beyond pure simulations. We also introduce VerilogEval-v2-EXT, extending the original benchmark with 53 more industrial-grade design tasks and stratified difficulty levels, and show that Veri-Sure achieves state-of-the-art verified-correct RTL code generation performance, surpassing standalone LLMs and prior agentic systems."}
