<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络管理需要专业知识，限制了普通用户的使用。通过LLM技术让非专家用户能够用自然语言管理网络，降低使用门槛。

Method: 设计基于LLM的代理框架，使用中间表示统一不同厂商设备配置，实时检索网络状态，提供外部反馈接口，并开发可视化界面收集用户数据。

Result: 初步实验验证了系统在合成和真实用户语句上的有效性，通过数据收集为LLM的进一步应用奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该系统为LLM在网络管理中的有效应用铺平了道路，使网络控制民主化，让日常用户能够轻松管理网络。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to network management have been accessible only to a
handful of highly-trained network operators with significant expert knowledge.
This creates barriers for lay users to easily manage their networks without
resorting to experts. With recent development of powerful large language models
(LLMs) for language comprehension, we design a system to make network
management accessible to a broader audience of non-experts by allowing users to
converse with networks in natural language. To effectively leverage
advancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate
representation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment,
retrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface
for external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data
of natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization
interface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale
data collection for future development. Preliminary experiments validate the
effectiveness of our proposed system components with LLM integration on both
synthetic and real user utterances. Through our data collection and
visualization efforts, we pave the way for more effective use of LLMs and
democratize network control for everyday users.

### [2] [An SDR-Based Test Platform for 5G NTN Prototyping and Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20692)
*Lu Hou,Kan Zheng,Jie Mei,Cheng Huang*

Main category: cs.NI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G NTN标准处于早期成熟阶段，缺乏商用设备，阻碍了性能验证和系统原型开发，需要搭建测试平台来填补这一空白。

Method: 采用软件定义无线电(SDR)测试平台，结合Amarisoft的5G NTN协议栈软件，进行定制化系统集成和适配，支持GEO卫星链路的双向通信。

Result: 通过现场试验评估了下行吞吐量和往返时延等性能指标，验证了SDR平台在NTN测试中的可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: SDR平台在NTN测试中具有潜力，能够在广泛商用部署前弥合当前实施差距。

Abstract: The integration of satellite communication into 5G has been formalized in
3GPP Release 17 through the specification of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN),
marking a significant step toward achieving global connectivity. However, the
early-stage maturity of 5G NTN standards and the lack of commercial NTN-capable
equipment hinder extensive performance validation and system prototyping. To
address this gap, this paper proposes a software-defined radio (SDR) test
platform with General-Purpose Processor (GPP) processing, leveraging
Amarisoft's 5G NTN protocol stack software while performing custom system
integration and adaptation for real satellite operation. The platform supports
bidirectional communication between an SDR-based NTN gNB and UE emulator
through a Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite link, with full compliance
to 3GPP NTN specifications. We provide detailed insights into the system
architecture, SDR hardware-software co-design, and satellite gateway
adaptations. Through field trials, we evaluate the performance metrics
including downlink throughput and round-trip time. Results validate the
feasibility and effectiveness of SDR-based platforms for NTN testing, and
highlight their potential in bridging current implementation gaps before
widespread commercial deployment.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has the potential to significantly reduce
communication delay in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications within
vehicular networks (VNs). However, the deployment of vehicular SemCom networks
(VN-SemComNets) faces critical trust challenges in information transmission,
semantic encoding, and communication entity reliability. This paper proposes an
innovative three-layer trustworthy VN-SemComNet architecture. Specifically, we
introduce a semantic camouflage transmission mechanism leveraging defensive
adversarial noise for active eavesdropping defense, a robust federated
encoder-decoder training framework to mitigate encoder-decoder poisoning
attacks, and an audit game-based distributed vehicle trust management mechanism
to deter untrustworthy vehicles. A case study validates the effectiveness of
the proposed solutions. Lastly, essential future research directions are
pointed out to advance this emerging field.

### [4] [BSB: Towards Demand-Aware Peer Selection With XOR-based Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20974)
*Qingyun Ji,Darya Melnyk,Arash Pourdamghani,Stefan Schmid*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的需求感知对等选择算法BSB，相比现有算法可提升43%的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对等选择算法忽视了应用特定的数据流量，导致连接利用不足、路径延长和延迟增加

Method: 基于局部贪婪的XOR路由机制，开发了Binary Search in Buckets (BSB)算法，保持与现有协议的兼容性

Result: 在真实世界和合成通信网络轨迹上的模拟显示，BSB相比文献中的两种算法可提供高达43%的改进

Conclusion: 需求感知的对等选择算法BSB能有效优化P2P网络的可扩展性和性能表现

Abstract: Peer-to-peer networks, as a key enabler of modern networked and distributed
systems, rely on peer-selection algorithms to optimize their scalability and
performance. Peer-selection methods have been studied extensively in various
aspects, including routing mechanisms and communication overhead. However, many
state-of-the-art algorithms are oblivious to application-specific data traffic.
This mismatch between design and demand results in underutilized connections,
which inevitably leads to longer paths and increased latency. In this work, we
propose a novel demand-aware peer-selection algorithm, called Binary Search in
Buckets (BSB). Our demand-aware approach adheres to a local and greedy
XOR-based routing mechanism, ensuring compatibility with existing protocols and
mechanisms. We evaluate our solution against two prior algorithms by conducting
simulations on real-world and synthetic communication network traces. The
results of our evaluations show that BSB can offer up to a 43% improvement
compared to two selected algorithms from the literature.

### [5] [A Novel Integrated Architecture for Intent Based Approach and Zero Touch Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21026)
*Neelam Gupta,Dibakar Das,Tamizhelakkiya K,Uma Maheswari Natarajan,Sharvari Ravindran,Komal Sharma,Jyotsna Bapat,Debabrata Das*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成意图驱动网络和零接触网络的创新架构，通过自然语言处理将用户意图转换为网络配置，并使用BiLSTM和Q学习算法实现自主网络管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需要自动化管理来满足多样化应用的QoS要求和SLA，传统网络管理方法难以应对变化的网络条件和实时需求。

Method: 使用NLP技术（如RAG）将自然语言意图转换为Nile语言，然后通过基于BiLSTM和Q学习的ZTN闭环控制框架实现意图目标的自主维护。

Result: 在OpenAirInterface测试床上实现并验证了架构，蒙特卡洛模拟和实测结果一致，能够自主实现用户设定的带宽目标，并测量了QoE的MOS评分。

Conclusion: 该集成架构能够通过简单的自然语言输入实现网络性能目标的自主维护，为6G网络的自动化管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The transition to Sixth Generation (6G) networks presents challenges in
managing quality of service (QoS) of diverse applications and achieving Service
Level Agreements (SLAs) under varying network conditions. Hence, network
management must be automated with the help of Machine Learning (ML) and
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve real-time requirements. Zero touch
network (ZTN) is one of the frameworks to automate network management with
mechanisms such as closed loop control to ensure that the goals are met
perpetually. Intent- Based Networking (IBN) specifies the user intents with
diverse network requirements or goals which are then translated into specific
network configurations and actions. This paper presents a novel architecture
for integrating IBN and ZTN to serve the intent goals. Users provides the
intent in the form of natural language, e.g., English, which is then translated
using natural language processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., retrieval augmented
generation (RAG)) into Network Intent LanguagE (Nile). The Nile intent is then
passed on to the BiLSTM and Q-learning based ZTN closed loop framework as a
goal which maintains the intent under varying network conditions. Thus, the
proposed architecture can work autonomously to ensure the network performance
goal is met by just specifying the user intent in English. The integrated
architecture is also implemented on a testbed using OpenAirInterface (OAI).
Additionally, to evaluate the architecture, an optimization problem is
formulated which evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results demonstrate
how ZTN can help achieve the bandwidth goals autonomously set by user intent.
The simulation and the testbed results are compared and they show similar
trend. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for Quality of Experience (QoE) is also
measured to indicate the user satisfaction of the intent.

### [6] [RePro: Leveraging Large Language Models for Semi-Automated Reproduction of Networking Research Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21074)
*Yining Jiang,Wenyun Xu,Qingyu Song,Yuling Lin,Xuanhao Liu,Xiaoqiang Zheng,Qiang Su,Lizhao You,Lu Tang,Wangjian Feng,Linghe Kong,Qiao Xiang,Jiwu Shu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: RePro是一个半自动化的网络研究复现框架，利用先进的提示工程技术从研究论文中生成可执行的网络系统代码，显著减少复现时间并保持系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络研究复现面临开源代码稀缺的挑战，现有LLM方法缺乏对多样化网络领域的泛化能力，需要一种更有效的自动化复现解决方案。

Method: RePro采用三阶段流水线：系统描述提取、结构化代码生成和代码优化，结合少样本上下文学习和结构化/语义思维链技术（SCoT/SeCoT）来系统化地翻译论文描述为优化后的可执行实现。

Result: 在五个最先进LLM和多样化网络子领域的评估中，RePro相比人工努力显著减少了复现时间，同时实现了可比的系统性能。

Conclusion: RePro验证了其在网络研究复现中的有效性和效率，为自动化研究复现提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Reproducing networking research is a critical but challenging task due to the
scarcity of open-source code. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate
code generation, current approaches lack the generalizability required for the
diverse networking field. To address this, we propose RePro, a semi-automated
reproduction framework that leverages advanced prompt engineering to reproduce
network systems from their research papers. RePro combines few-shot in-context
learning with Structured and Semantic Chain of Thought (SCoT/SeCoT) techniques
to systematically translate a paper's description into an optimized, executable
implementation. The framework operates through a three-stage pipeline: system
description extraction, structural code generation, and code optimization. Our
evaluation with five state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse network sub-domains
demonstrates that RePro significantly reduces reproduction time compared to
manual efforts while achieving comparable system performance, validating its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [Hybrid RIS-Aided Digital Over-the-Air Computing for Edge AI Inference: Joint Feature Quantization and Active-Passive Beamforming Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21201)
*Yang Fu,Peng Qin,Liming Chen,Yifei Wang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合RIS辅助的数字空中计算方案(HRD-AirComp)，通过矢量量化和数字调制实现特征聚合，提升边缘推理的准确性和不确定性表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需要支持边缘推理，现有空中计算技术(AirComp)虽然能快速聚合多视角传感特征，但与数字通信系统不兼容，而混合RIS架构具有同时信号放大和反射的能力

Method: 采用矢量量化将高维特征映射为离散码字，数字调制后进行无线传输，通过联合优化量化比特分配、传输系数、接收波束成形和RIS反射波束成形来控制信号叠加

Result: 实验结果表明HRD-AirComp在推理准确性和不确定性方面均优于基线方法

Conclusion: 所提出的HRD-AirComp方案成功实现了数字通信系统与空中计算的兼容，为6G边缘推理提供了有效的任务导向设计框架

Abstract: The vision of 6G networks aims to enable edge inference by leveraging
ubiquitously deployed artificial intelligence (AI) models, facilitating
intelligent environmental perception for a wide range of applications. A
critical operation in edge inference is for an edge node (EN) to aggregate
multi-view sensory features extracted by distributed agents, thereby boosting
perception accuracy. Over-the-air computing (AirComp) emerges as a promising
technique for rapid feature aggregation by exploiting the waveform
superposition property of analog-modulated signals, which is, however,
incompatible with existing digital communication systems. Meanwhile, hybrid
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a novel RIS architecture capable of
simultaneous signal amplification and reflection, exhibits potential for
enhancing AirComp. Therefore, this paper proposes a Hybrid RIS-aided Digital
AirComp (HRD-AirComp) scheme, which employs vector quantization to map
high-dimensional features into discrete codewords that are digitally modulated
into symbols for wireless transmission. By judiciously adjusting the AirComp
transceivers and hybrid RIS reflection to control signal superposition across
agents, the EN can estimate the aggregated features from the received signals.
To endow HRD-AirComp with a task-oriented design principle, we derive a
surrogate function for inference accuracy that characterizes the impact of
feature quantization and over-the-air aggregation. Based on this surrogate, we
formulate an optimization problem targeting inference accuracy maximization,
and develop an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize the quantization bit
allocation, agent transmission coefficients, EN receiving beamforming, and
hybrid RIS reflection beamforming. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed HRD-AirComp outperforms baselines in terms of both inference accuracy
and uncertainty.

### [8] [Semantic Edge-Cloud Communication for Real-Time Urban Traffic Surveillance with ViT and LLMs over Mobile Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21259)
*Murat Arda Onsu,Poonam Lohan,Burak Kantarci,Aisha Syed,Matthew Andrews,Sean Kennedy*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出基于语义通信的边缘-云框架，通过YOLOv11检测感兴趣区域、ViT生成紧凑嵌入向量，在传输数据量减少99.9%的情况下保持89%的LLM响应准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时交通监控中多模态大语言模型在边缘设备部署困难、云端推理需要大量数据传输但带宽有限导致实时性能受损的问题

Method: 使用YOLOv11检测感兴趣区域，裁剪相关图像片段，通过Vision Transformer转换为紧凑嵌入向量传输到云端，图像解码器重建图像后由多模态LLM生成交通状况描述

Result: 数据传输大小减少99.9%，重建裁剪图像的LLM响应准确率达到89%（原始裁剪图像为93%）

Conclusion: ViT和LLM辅助的边缘-云语义通信框架在实时交通监控中具有高效性和实用性

Abstract: Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle
trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras
across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road
conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a
robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface
for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can
interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment
on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM
inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from
edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential
delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we
propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces
transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)
using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into
compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings
are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the
cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to
generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9%
reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy
of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original
cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT
and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic
surveillance.

### [9] [Pedagogically Motivated and Composable Open-Source RISC-V Processors for Computer Science Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20514)
*Ian McDougall,Harish Batchu,Michael Davies,Karthikeyan Sankaralingam*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一套评估RISC-V实现的教学标准，分析了现有开源实现，并开发了一个满足所有标准的开源框架，支持模块化教学使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC-V ISA作为免费开源的指令集架构，为教学和业余使用提供了良好基础，但需要一个易于使用且健壮的开源实现。

Method: 提出教学评估标准，分析现有开源RISC-V实现，开发满足所有标准的开源框架，并进行学生反馈研究。

Result: 开发了一个全面的开源解决方案，满足所有教学标准，支持模块化组合使用。

Conclusion: 该框架为RISC-V教学提供了完整的开源解决方案，可根据课程需求灵活配置组件。

Abstract: While most instruction set architectures (ISAs) are only available to use
through the purchase of a restrictive commercial license, the RISC-V ISA
presents a free and open-source alternative. Due to this availability, many
free and open-source implementations have been developed and can be accessed on
platforms such as GitHub. If an open source, easy-to-use, and robust RISC-V
implementation could be obtained, it could be easily adapted for pedagogical
and amateur use. In this work we accomplish three goals in relation to this
outlook. First, we propose a set of criteria for evaluating the components of a
RISC-V implementation's ecosystem from a pedagogical perspective. Second, we
analyze a number of existing open-source RISC-V implementations to determine
how many of the criteria they fulfill. We then develop a comprehensive solution
that meets all of these criterion and is released open-source for other
instructors to use. The framework is developed in a composable way that it's
different components can be disaggregated per individual course needs. Finally,
we also report on a limited study of student feedback.

### [10] [ZynqParrot: A Scale-Down Approach to Cycle-Accurate, FPGA-Accelerated Co-Emulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20543)
*Daniel Ruelas-Petrisko,Farzam Gilani,Anoop Mysore Nataraja,Zoe Taylor,Michael Taylor*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出了一种Scale-Down FPGA建模平台ZynqParrot，通过将复杂系统分解为可独立原型化的子组件，实现快速准确的周期精确协同仿真


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着处理器复杂度增加，功能验证和性能验证成本急剧增长。传统性能计数器推断和模拟器方法存在运行时间长、不准确的问题

Method: 采用Scale-Down方法，将系统分解为可管理的子组件独立原型化，设计非干扰的原型接口，保持被测设备的严格非干扰性

Result: 开发了ZynqParrot平台，能够执行任意RTL设计的非干扰周期精确协同仿真，验证功能和性能

Conclusion: Scale-Down方法提供了FPGA加速的速度优势，同时消除了Scale-Out的不准确性和Scale-Up的高成本，为架构师提供了最佳解决方案

Abstract: As processors increase in complexity, costs grow even more rapidly, both for
functional verification and performance validation. Most often, silicon
characterizations comprise simple performance counters, which are aggregated
and separated to tell a story. Based on these inferences, performance engineers
employ microarchitectural simulation to inspect deeply into the core.
Unfortunately, dramatically longer runtimes make simulation infeasible for long
workloads.
  We propose a Scale-Down approach to modelling and validation. Rather than
up-sizing a prototyping platform to fit large and complex system designs, we
show that it can be more accurate, faster, and more economical to decompose a
system into manageable sub-components that can be prototyped independently. By
carefully designing the prototyping interface, it is possible to adhere to
strict non-interference of the Device Under Test (DUT). This allows architects
to have the best of both worlds: the speed of FPGA acceleration while
eliminating the inaccuracies of Scale-Out and the inherent costs of Scale-Up.
  In this work, we present ZynqParrot: a Scale-Down FPGA-based modelling
platform, capable of executing non-interfering, cycle-accurate co-emulations of
arbitrary RTL designs. ZynqParrot is capable of verifying functionality and
performance with arbitrary granularity. We also provide case studies using
ZynqParrot to analyze the full-stack performance of an open-source RISC-V
processor.
