Existing RAN slicing frameworks predominantly rely on per-slice resource reservation, which ensures performance isolation but leads to inefficient utilization, particularly under bursty traffic. We introduce HyRA, a hybrid resource allocation framework for RAN slicing that combines dedicated per-slice allocations with shared resource pooling across slices. HyRA preserves performance isolation while improving resource efficiency by leveraging multiplexing gains in bursty traffic conditions. We formulate this design as a bi-level stochastic optimization problem, where the outer loop determines the dedicated and shared resource budgets and the inner loop performs per-UE scheduling under a novel water-filling approach. By using the sample-average approximation, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the inner loop, and Big-M encoding, we transform the problem into a tractable mixed-integer program that standard optimization solvers can solve. Extensive simulations under diverse demand patterns, SLA configurations, and traffic burstiness show that HyRA achieves up to 50-75% spectrum savings compared to dedicated-only and shared-only baselines. These results highlight HyRA as a viable approach for resource-efficient, SLA-compliant RAN slicing in future mobile networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Evaluating these investments requires longitudinal visibility into broadband availability, quality, and affordability, including data on pre-disbursement baselines and changes in providers' advertised plans. While such data can be obtained through Internet Service Provider (ISP) web interfaces, these workloads impose three fundamental system requirements: robustness to frequent interface evolution, extensibility across hundreds of providers, and low technical overhead for non-expert users. Existing systems fail to meet these three essential requirements.\n  We present BQT+, a broadband plan measurement framework that replaces monolithic workflows with declarative state/action specifications. BQT+ models querying intent as an interaction state space, formalized as an abstract nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), and selects execution paths at runtime to accommodate alternative interaction flows and localized interface changes. We show that BQT+ sustains longitudinal monitoring of 64 ISPs, supporting querying for over 100 ISPs.

Although specialized accelerators are increasingly adopted, many inference workloads still run on CPU-only systems, particularly in legacy data centers and cost-sensitive environments.

In contrast, the Granite Rapids system leverages Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) to achieve substantially higher throughput. However, oversubscription beyond physical core limits introduces execution contention and tail-latency amplification, revealing a performance degradation regime in modern architectures.\n  We introduce GDEV-AI, a reproducible benchmarking framework for analyzing scalability behavior and architectural saturation in CPU-based inference.

The framework links inspection records, material production and placement data, early-age sensing, and predictive strength models to individual construction elements. By integrating these data streams, the system represents the evolving quality state of each element and supports structured release or hold decisions before standard-age test results are available. The approach does not replace established inspection and testing procedures. Instead, it supplements existing workflows by improving traceability and enabling earlier, data-informed quality assessments.

Recently, Read-Modify-Writable (RMWable) snapshot was proposed, a variant of snapshot that allows processes to perform operations more complex than just read and write, specifically, each entry MEM[k] is an arbitrary readable object. The known RMWable snapshot algorithms heavily rely on powerful low-level operations such as compare&swap or load-link/store-conditional to correctly produce snapshots of MEM. Following the large body of research devoted to understand the limits of what can be solved using the simple read/write low-level operations, which are known to be strictly weaker than compare&swap and load-link/store-conditional, we explore if RMWable snapshots are possible using only read/write operations. We present two read/write RMWable snapshot algorithms, the first one in the standard concurrent shared-memory model where the number of processes n is finite and known in advance, and the second one in a variant of the standard model with unbounded concurrency, where there are infinitely many processes, but at any moment only finitely many processes participate in an execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u5e76\u53d1\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8bfb\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0RMWable\u5feb\u7167\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fdb\u7a0b\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e76\u53d1\u65e0\u754c\u4f46\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u7a0b\u6709\u9650\u7684 \u00e9l\u00e8ves\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u6709RMWable\u5feb\u7167\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u5927\u5e95\u5c42\u64cd\u4f5c\u5982compare&swap\uff0c\u800c\u6211\u4eec\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4ec5\u7528\u8f83\u5f31\u8bfb\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u5426\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u7c7b\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u8fdb\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u57fa\u7840\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9n\u8fdb\u7a0b\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5e76\u53d1\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u754c\u5e76\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8fdb\u7a0b\u6570\u65e0\u7a77\u4f46\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u6d3b\u8dc3\u8fdb\u7a0b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5747\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bfb\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8bfb\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684RMWable\u5feb\u7167\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700compare&swap\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u8bfb\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86RMWable\u5feb\u7167\u5728\u5f31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we design M2LSimu, a mobility measures-guided multi-prompt adjustment framework that leverages mobility measures derived from shared data as guidance to refine individual-level prompts for realistic mobility generation. Our framework applies coarse-grained adjustment strategies guided by mobility measures, progressively enabling fine-grained individual-level adaptation while satisfying multiple population-level mobility objectives under a limited budget.

This commonly involves a multitude of processing services, executed with limited resources; this setup faces three problems: first, the application demand and the resource availability fluctuate, so the service execution must scale dynamically to sustain processing requirements (e.g., latency); second, each service permits different actions to adjust its operation, so they require individual scaling policies; third, without a higher-level mediator, services would cannibalize any resources of services co-located on the same device. This demo first presents a platform for context-aware autoscaling of stream processing services that allows developers to monitor and adjust the service execution across multiple service-specific parameters. We then connect a scaling agent to these interfaces that gradually builds an understanding of the processing environment by exploring each service's action space; the agent then optimizes the service execution according to this knowledge.

Federated Learning (FL) extends this capability by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), while preserving data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. However, practical deployments face challenges when clients have heterogeneous resources and thus adopt different LoRA ranks, leading to substantial initialization and aggregation noise that undermines performance. To address these challenges, we propose Fed-PLoRA, a novel lightweight heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (FFT) framework. Fed-PLoRA introduces Parallel One-Rank Adaptation (PLoRA), a new LoRA variant that replaces the classic multi-rank LoRA module with multiple parallel one-rank modules, and a novel Select-N-Fold strategy that folds untrained PLoRA modules into the pre-trained weights before local training, thereby accommodating heterogeneous client resources.

Traditional approaches rely on static, offline-trained models that cannot adapt to evolving operational conditions, while LLM-based monolithic systems demand prohibitive memory and latency, rendering them impractical for on-site edge deployment. We introduce SEMAS, a self-evolving hierarchical multi-agent system that distributes specialized agents across Edge, Fog, and Cloud computational tiers. Edge agents perform lightweight feature extraction and pre-filtering; Fog agents execute diversified ensemble detection with dynamic consensus voting; and Cloud agents continuously optimize system policies via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) while maintaining asynchronous, non-blocking inference. The framework incorporates LLM-based response generation for explainability and federated knowledge aggregation for adaptive policy distribution. This architecture enables resource-aware specialization without sacrificing real-time performance or model interpretability. Empirical evaluation on two industrial benchmarks (Boiler Emulator and Wind Turbine) demonstrates that SEMAS achieves superior anomaly detection performance with exceptional stability under adaptation, sustains prediction accuracy across evolving operational contexts, and delivers substantial latency improvements enabling genuine real-time deployment. Ablation studies confirm that PPO-driven policy evolution, consensus voting, and federated aggregation each contribute materially to system effectiveness.

We present AdaptOrch, a formal framework for task-adaptive multi-agent orchestration that dynamically selects among four canonical topologies (parallel, sequential, hierarchical, and hybrid) based on task dependency graphs and empirically derived domain characteristics. Our framework introduces three key contributions: (1) a Performance Convergence Scaling Law, formalizing conditions under which orchestration selection outweighs model selection; (2) a Topology Routing Algorithm that maps task decomposition DAGs to optimal orchestration patterns in O(|V| + |E|) time; and (3) an Adaptive Synthesis Protocol with provable termination guarantees and heuristic consistency scoring for parallel agent outputs. We validate AdaptOrch across coding (SWE-bench), reasoning (GPQA), and retrieval-augmented generation tasks, demonstrating that topology-aware orchestration achieves 12-23% improvement over static single-topology baselines, even when using identical underlying models.

Recent designs incorporating optical circuit switches (OCSes) are promising, offering improved cost, power efficiency, and long-term bandwidth scaling than packet switches. However, most existing approaches rely on costly high-radix OCSes and/or combine them with packet switches to achieve competitive performance at scale. Unfortunately, high-radix OCSes are both expensive and slow to reconfigure, limiting both scalability and performance.\n  We propose Arrays of Cheap Optical Switches (ACOS), which bring application co-design directly to the structure of the reconfigurable fabric. Using low-radix OCSes as building blocks, ACOS supports the forms of reconfiguration needed in training clusters including topology selection, workload adaptation, and failure resilience. The cost of ACOS scales with supported topologies and adaptations rather than with port count, breaking past the scalability barriers of current specialized ML networks. We show through simulation that ACOS-based deployments match the performance of fully provisioned packet-switched networks when training state-of-the-art LLMs at scale, while delivering significant cost savings using existing off-the-shelf OCSes, with strong bandwidth scaling and higher cost savings in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We investigate what kinds of plugins exist within this hybrid ecosystem and establish a foundation for understanding how they are maintained.

In many formal settings, such as circuit specifications, examinations, and hardware documentation, operators and components are explicitly redefined within narrow scope. Correct reasoning in these contexts requires models to temporarily suppress globally learned conventions in favor of prompt-local definitions. In this work, we study a systematic failure mode we term semantic override, in which an LLM reverts to its pretrained default interpretation of operators or gate behavior despite explicit redefinition in the prompt. We also identify a related class of errors, assumption injection, where models commit to unstated hardware semantics when critical details are underspecified, rather than requesting clarification.

However, these agents are prone to a wide range of misbehaviors, such as deviating from the user's instructions, getting stuck in repetitive loops, or failing to use tools correctly. These failures disrupt the development workflow and often require resource-intensive manual intervention. In this paper, we present a system for automatically recovering from agentic misbehaviors at scale. We first introduce a taxonomy of misbehaviors grounded in an analysis of production traffic, identifying three primary categories: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures, which we find occur in about 30% of all agent trajectories.\n  To address these issues, we developed a lightweight, asynchronous self-intervention system named Wink. Wink observes agent trajectories and provides targeted course-correction guidance to nudge the agent back to a productive path. We evaluated our system on over 10,000 real world agent trajectories and found that it successfully resolves 90% of the misbehaviors that require a single intervention. Furthermore, a live A/B test in our production environment demonstrated that our system leads to a statistically significant reduction in Tool Call Failures, Tokens per Session and Engineer Interventions per Session. We present our experience designing and deploying this system, offering insights into the challenges of building resilient agentic systems at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using real workload traces from the Cori, Eagle, and Theta supercomputers, we simulate varying proportions (0-100%) of malleable jobs with the ElastiSim software.\n  We evaluate five job scheduling strategies, including a novel one that maintains malleable jobs at their preferred resource allocation when possible. Results show that, compared to fully rigid workloads, malleable jobs yield significant improvements across all key metrics. Considering the best-performing scheduling strategy for each supercomputer, job turnaround times decrease by 37-67%, job makespan by 16-65%, job wait times by 73-99%, and node utilization improves by 5-52%. Although improvements vary, gains remain substantial even at 20% malleable jobs.\n  This work highlights important correlations between workload characteristics (e.g., job runtimes and node requirements), malleability proportions, and scheduling strategies.

Recent studies demonstrate that carefully designed multi-agent workflows and communication graphs can significantly improve code generation performance by leveraging collaborative reasoning. However, existing methods neither adapt topology density to task difficulty nor iteratively refine the topology within an instance using execution feedback, which leads to redundant communication and performance bottlenecks. To address these issues, we propose AgentConductor: a reinforcement learning-optimized MAS with an LLM-based orchestrator agent as its core, which enables end-to-end feedback-driven dynamic generation of interaction topologies. For each query, AgentConductor infers agent roles and task difficulty, then constructs a task-adapted, density-aware layered directed acyclic graph (DAG) topology, underpinned by two key innovations. First, we design a novel topological density function that captures communication-aware mathematical characterizations of multi-agent interactions. Second, we adopt difficulty interval partitioning to avoid excessive pruning for precise topological density upper bound measurement per difficulty level and finer-grained control. Empirically, across three competition-level and two foundational code datasets, AgentConductor achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by up to 14.6% in pass@1 accuracy, 13% in density reduction, and 68% in token cost reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To study collusion risk, we introduce a meta-game design for analyzing algorithmic behavior under test-time constraints. We model agents as possessing pretrained policies with distinct strategic characteristics (e.g., competitive, naively cooperative, robustly collusive), and formulate the problem as selecting a meta-strategy that combines a pretrained, initial policy with an in-game adaptation rule. We seek to examine whether collusion can emerge under rational choices and how agents co-adapt toward cooperation or competition. To this end, we sample normal-form empirical games over meta-strategy profiles, % across random initial game states, compute relevant game statistics (e.g., payoffs against individuals and regret against an equilibrium mixture of opponents), and construct empirical best-response graphs to uncover strategic relationships. We evaluate both reinforcement-learning and LLM-based strategies in repeated pricing games under symmetric and asymmetric cost settings, and present findings on the feasibility of algorithmic collusion and the effectiveness of pricing strategies in practical ``test-time'' environments.\n  The source code and the full paper with appendix are available at: https://github.com/chailab-rutgers/CollusionMetagame.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Experimental results on real-world scientific datasets show that TopoSZp achieves 3 to 100 times fewer non-preserved critical points, introduces no false positives or incorrect critical point types, and delivers 100 to 10000 times faster compression and 10 to 500 times faster decompression compared to existing topology-aware compressors, while maintaining competitive compression ratios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TopoSZp\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff08\u5982\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3001\u6700\u5927\u503c\u548c\u978d\u70b9\uff09\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u89e3\u538b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff08\u5982SZ\u548cZFP\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21HPC\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548SZp\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u987a\u5e8f\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u978d\u70b9\u7ec6\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u653e\u677e\u4f46\u4e25\u683c\u9519\u8bef\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff0cTopoSZp\u975e\u4fdd\u7559\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u51cf\u5c113\u81f3100\u500d\uff0c\u65e0\u5047\u9633\u6027\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb100\u81f310000\u500d\uff0c\u89e3\u538b\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb10\u81f3500\u500d\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TopoSZp\u9ad8\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002 \u0641\u0627\u0642\u062f"}}

This cycle is accelerating, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as web development and deep learning. However, the impact of competitive relationships among OSS projects on their survival remains unclear, and there are risks of losing a competitive edge to rivals. To address this, this study proposes a new automated method called ``Mutual Impact Analysis of OSS (MIAO)'' to quantify these competitive relationships. The proposed method employs a structural vector autoregressive model and impulse response functions, normally used in macroeconomic analysis, to analyze the interactions among OSS projects. In an empirical analysis involving mining and analyzing 187 OSS project groups, MIAO identified projects that were forced to cease development owing to competitive influences with up to 81\\% accuracy, and the resulting features supported predictive experiments that anticipate cessation one year ahead with up to 77\\% accuracy.

Whilst POSIX distributed file systems and NVMe SSDs are currently a common HPC storage configuration providing I/O to applications, new storage solutions have proliferated or gained traction over the last decade with potential to address performance limitations POSIX file systems manifest at scale for certain I/O workloads.\n  This work has primarily aimed to assess the suitability and performance of two object storage systems -namely DAOS and Ceph- for the ECMWF's operational NWP as well as for HPC and AI applications in general. New software-level adapters have been developed which enable the ECMWF's NWP to leverage these systems, and extensive I/O benchmarking has been conducted on a few computer systems, comparing the performance delivered by the evaluated object stores to that of equivalent Lustre file system deployments on the same hardware. Challenges of porting to object storage and its benefits with respect to the traditional POSIX I/O approach have been discussed and, where possible, domain-agnostic performance analysis has been conducted, leading to insight also of relevance to I/O practitioners and the broader HPC community.\n  DAOS and Ceph have both demonstrated excellent performance, but DAOS stood out relative to Ceph and Lustre, providing superior scalability and flexibility for applications to perform I/O at scale as desired. This sets a promising outlook for DAOS and object storage, which might see greater adoption at HPC centres in the years to come, although not necessarily implying a shift away from POSIX-like I/O.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) has been an essential part of the web since the beginning, as it allows defining webpages in a tree-like manner, including semantics and content. Although the web was never meant to be an application platform, it evolved as such, especially since the early 2000s, as web application frameworks became available. While the emergence of frameworks made it easier than ever to develop complex applications, it also put HTML on the back burner. As web standards caught up, especially with milestones such as HTML5, the gap between the web platform and frameworks was reduced. HTML First development emphasizes this shift and puts focus on literally using HTML first when possible, while encouraging minimalism familiar from the early days of the web. It seems HTML-oriented web development can provide clear benefits to developers, especially when it is combined with comple- mentary approaches, such as embracing hypermedia and moving a large part of application logic to the server side. In the context of the htmx project, it was observed that moving towards HTML can reduce the size of a codebase greatly while leading to maintenance and development benefits due to the increased conceptual simplicity. Holotype-based comparisons for content-oriented websites show performance benefits, and the same observation was confirmed by a small case study where the Yle website was converted to follow HTML First principles. In short, the HTML First approach seems to have clear advantages for web developers, while there are open questions related to the magnitude of the benefits and the alignment with the recent trend of AI-driven web development.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

With major corporations and academic institutions investing in quantum hardware and software, there has been a rise in the development of quantum-enabled systems, particularly within open-source communities. However, despite the promising nature of quantum technologies, these communities face critical socio-technical challenges, including the emergence of socio-technical anti-patterns known as community smells. These anti-patterns, prevalent in open-source environments, have the potential to negatively impact both product quality and community health by introducing technical debt and amplifying architectural and code smells. Despite the importance of these socio-technical factors, there remains a scarcity of research investigating their influence within quantum open-source communities. This work aims to address this gap by providing a first step in analyzing the socio-technical well-being of quantum communities through a cross-sectional study. By understanding the socio-technical dynamics at play, it is expected that foundational knowledge can be established to mitigate the risks associated with community smells and ensure the long-term sustainability of open-source quantum initiatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current approaches typically encode ethics as fixed, rule-based constraints or as a single chosen ethical theory embedded at design time. This overlooks a fundamental property of human-system interaction settings: ethical preferences vary across individuals and groups, evolve with context, and may conflict, while still needing to remain within a legally and regulatorily defined hard-ethics envelope (e.g., safety and compliance constraints). This paper advocates a shift from static ethical rules to runtime ethical reasoning for self-adaptive systems, where ethical preferences are treated as runtime requirements that must be elicited, represented, and continuously revised as stakeholders and situations change. We argue that satisfying such requirements demands explicit ethics-based negotiation to manage ethical trade-offs among multiple humans who interact with, are represented by, or are affected by a system. We identify key challenges, ethical uncertainty, conflicts among ethical values (including human, societal, and environmental drivers), and multi-dimensional/multi-party/multi-driver negotiation, and outline research directions and questions toward ethically self-adaptive systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u4f26\u7406\u89c4\u5219\u8f6c\u5411\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f26\u7406\u504f\u597d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u53d8\u8fc1\u6027\u53ca\u51b2\u7a81\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u6cd5\u5408\u89c4\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9053\u5fb7\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e92\u52a8\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u4f26\u7406\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ecd\u9700\u9075\u5b88\u6cd5\u5f8b\u786c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u5408\u89c4\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u504f\u597d\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f26\u7406\u534f\u5546\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3001\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u4fee\u8ba2\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7ba1\u7406\u591a\u65b9\u9053\u5fb7\u53d6\u820d\uff08\u5982\u7528\u6237\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u9053\u5fb7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u51b2\u7a81\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u4eba\u7c7b\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\u53ca\u591a\u7ef4\u591a\u515a\u591a\u9a71\u52a8\u8c08\u5224\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u52fe\u52d2\u4e86\u4f26\u7406\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6b63\u597d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f26\u7406\u5065\u5168\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5fc5\u987b\u6574\u5408\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u534f\u5546\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9053\u5fb7\u8d38\u6613\u53d6\u820d\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, they are often developed from scratch despite functional overlaps, and abandoned after publication. This lack of interoperability and maintenance incurs unnecessary development effort, impedes tool comparison and benchmarking, complicates documentation, and diminishes the long-term sustainability of NLP4RE tools. To address these issues, we postulate a vision to transition from monolithic NLP4RE tools to an ecosystem of reusable, interoperable modules. We outline a research roadmap towards a software reference architecture (SRA) to realize this vision, elaborated following a standard methodological framework for SRA development. As an initial step, we conducted a stakeholder-driven focus group session to elicit generic system requirements for NLP4RE tools. This activity resulted in 36 key system requirements, further motivating the need for a dedicated SRA. Overall, the proposed vision, roadmap, and initial contribution pave the way towards improved development, reuse, and long-term maintenance of NLP4RE tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
