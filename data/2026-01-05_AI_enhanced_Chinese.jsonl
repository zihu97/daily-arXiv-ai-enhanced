Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are conventionally suggested to overcome the read disturbance errors in STT-MRAM caches. By employing aggressive ECCs and checking out a cache block on every read access, a high level of cache reliability is achieved. However, to minimize the cache access time in modern processors, all blocks in the target cache set are simultaneously read in parallel for tags comparison operation and only the requested block is sent out, if any, after checking its ECC. These extra cache block reads without checking their ECCs until requesting the blocks by the processor cause the accumulation of read disturbance error, which significantly degrade the cache reliability. In this paper, we first introduce and formulate the read disturbance accumulation phenomenon and reveal that this accumulation due to conventional parallel accesses of cache blocks significantly increases the cache error rate. Then, we propose a simple yet effective scheme, so-called Read Error Accumulation Preventer cache (REAP-cache), to completely eliminate the accumulation of read disturbances without compromising the cache performance. Our evaluations show that the proposed REAP-cache extends the cache Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) by 171x, while increases the cache area by less than 1% and energy consumption by only 2.7%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faREAP-cache\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664STT-MRAM\u7f13\u5b58\u4e2d\u8bfb\u6270\u52a8\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u529f\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "STT-MRAM\u7f13\u5b58\u56e0\u5e76\u884c\u8bfb\u53d6\u672a\u6821\u9a8cECC\u7684\u5757\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bfb\u6270\u52a8\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faREAP-cache\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u963b\u6b62\u8bfb\u6270\u52a8\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u8bf7\u6c42\u5757\u8fdb\u884cECC\u6821\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eREAP-cache\u4f7f\u7f13\u5b58\u5e73\u5747\u6545\u969c\u95f4\u9694\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u5347171\u500d\uff0c\u9762\u79ef\u589e\u52a0<1%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u4ec5\u589e2.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "REAP-cache\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3STT-MRAM\u7f13\u5b58\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662f\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper presents $\u03bc$ACP, a formal calculus for expressive agent communication under explicit resource bounds. We formalize the Resource-Constrained Agent Communication (RCAC) model, prove that a minimal four-verb basis \\textit{\\{PING, TELL, ASK, OBSERVE\\}} is suffices to encode finite-state FIPA protocols, and establish tight information-theoretic bounds on message complexity. We further show that $\u03bc$ACP can implement standard consensus under partial synchrony and crash faults, yielding a constructive coordination framework for edge-native agents. Formal verification in TLA$^{+}$ (model checking) and Coq (mechanized invariants) establishes safety and boundedness, and supports liveness under modeled assumptions. Large-scale system simulations confirm ACP achieves a median end-to-end message latency of 34 ms (95th percentile 104 ms) at scale, outperforming prior agent and IoT protocols under severe resource constraints.

Log4j is an industrial-grade Java logging framework listed as one of the top 100 critical open source projects. On Dec. 10, 2021 a severe vulnerability Log4Shell was disclosed before being fully patched with Log4j2 version 2.17.0 on Dec. 18, 2021. However, to this day about 4.1 million, or 33 percent of all Log4j downloads in the last 7 days contain vulnerable packages. Many Log4Shell scanners have since been created to detect if a user's installed Log4j version is vulnerable. Current detection tools primarily focus on identifying the version of Log4j installed, leading to numerous false positives, as they do not check if the software scanned is really vulnerable to malicious actors. This research aims to develop an advanced Log4j scanning tool that can evaluate the real-world exploitability of the software, thereby reducing false positives. Our approach first identifies vulnerabilities and then provides targeted recommendations for mitigating these detected vulnerabilities, along with instant feedback to users. By leveraging GitHub Actions, our tool offers automated and continuous scanning capabilities, ensuring timely identification of vulnerabilities as code changes occur. This integration into existing development workflows enables real-time monitoring and quicker responses to potential threats. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating 28 open-source software projects across different releases, achieving an accuracy rate of 91.4% from a sample of 140 scans.

This paper proposes the Activity-based First Contact (A-FC) protocol, an innovative routing scheme that leverages real-world social roles to overcome network partitioning by mandatorily uploading messages to highly active \"staff nodes\". We constructed a real-world evaluation scenario based on the topology of Fuzhou No. 1 Middle School. Simulation results demonstrate that the A-FC protocol significantly outperforms baseline protocols, achieving approximately 68% message delivery probability and reducing average delay to 4311 seconds.

Although edge-cloud collaborative inference with speculative decoding (SD) can reduce end-to-end latency by executing a lightweight draft model at the edge and verifying it with a cloud-side target model, existing frameworks fundamentally rely on tight coupling between the two models. Consequently, repeated model synchronization introduces excessive communication overhead, increasing end-to-end latency, and ultimately limiting the scalability of SD in edge environments. To address these limitations, we propose FlexSpec, a communication-efficient collaborative inference framework tailored for evolving edge-cloud systems. The core design of FlexSpec is a shared-backbone architecture that allows a single and static edge-side draft model to remain compatible with a large family of evolving cloud-side target models. By decoupling edge deployment from cloud-side model updates, FlexSpec eliminates the need for edge-side retraining or repeated model downloads, substantially reducing communication and maintenance costs. Furthermore, to accommodate time-varying wireless conditions and heterogeneous device constraints, we develop a channel-aware adaptive speculation mechanism that dynamically adjusts the speculative draft length based on real-time channel state information and device energy budgets.

Unlike function-level code generation, it requires the model to understand the entire repository, reasoning over complex dependencies across functions, classes, and modules. However, existing approaches such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or context-based function selection often fall short: they primarily rely on surface-level similarity and struggle to capture the rich dependencies that govern repository-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce InlineCoder, a novel framework for repository-level code generation. InlineCoder enhances the understanding of repository context by inlining the unfinished function into its call graph, thereby reframing the challenging repository understanding as an easier function-level coding task.

Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPONs) have emerged as a promising fronthaul solution due to their cost efficiency and compatibility with existing infrastructure. However, the traditional registration process for EPON systems halts the ongoing data transmissions during the registration period, thereby violating the enhanced Common Public Radio Interface (eCPRI) delay and jitter requirements. This limitation has been acknowledged by the ITU-T, which recommends the use of a dedicated wavelength channel for registration, leading to inefficient bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduling framework for a Time and Wavelength Division Multiplexed (TWDM) EPON-based fronthaul that enables periodic registration without wasting an additional wavelength channel.

To showcase how to use agents working in tandem with developers, we designed a novel approach for carrying out coordinated renaming. Coordinated renaming, where a single rename refactoring triggers refactorings in multiple, related identifiers, is a frequent yet challenging task. Developers must manually propagate these rename refactorings across numerous files and contexts, a process that is both tedious and highly error-prone. State-of-the-art heuristic-based approaches produce an overwhelming number of false positives, while vanilla Large Language Models (LLMs) provide incomplete suggestions due to their limited context and inability to interact with refactoring tools. This leaves developers with incomplete refactorings or burdens them with filtering too many false positives. Coordinated renaming is exactly the kind of repetitive task that agents can significantly reduce the developers' burden while keeping them in the driver's seat.\n  We designed, implemented, and evaluated the first multi-agent framework that automates coordinated renaming. It operates on a key insight: a developer's initial refactoring is a clue to infer the scope of related refactorings. Our Scope Inference Agent first transforms this clue into an explicit, natural-language Declared Scope. The Planned Execution Agent then uses this as a strict plan to identify program elements that should undergo refactoring and safely executes the changes by invoking the IDE's own trusted refactoring APIs.

However, these systems are prone to inaccurate, fictitious, or harmful responses, and their vast, high-dimensional input space makes systematic testing particularly challenging. To address this, we present STELLAR, an automated search-based testing framework for LLM-based applications that systematically uncovers text inputs leading to inappropriate system responses. Our framework models test generation as an optimization problem and discretizes the input space into stylistic, content-related, and perturbation features. Unlike prior work that focuses on prompt optimization or coverage heuristics, our work employs evolutionary optimization to dynamically explore feature combinations that are more likely to expose failures. We evaluate STELLAR on three LLM-based conversational question-answering systems. The first focuses on safety, benchmarking both public and proprietary LLMs against malicious or unsafe prompts. The second and third target navigation, using an open-source and an industrial retrieval-augmented system for in-vehicle venue recommendations. Overall, STELLAR exposes up to 4.3 times (average 2.5 times) more failures than the existing baseline approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "STELLAR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5f53\u54cd\u5e94\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5e94\u7528\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6216\u6709\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8fdb\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u63a2\u7d22\u6613\u5f15\u53d1\u6545\u969c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSTELLAR\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u591a\u53d1\u73b02.5\u500d\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe4.3\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "STELLAR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u66b4\u9732LLM\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
