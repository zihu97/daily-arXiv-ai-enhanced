Agentic approaches typically employ sparse retrieval methods like BM25 or dense embedding strategies to identify relevant units. While embedding-based approaches can outperform BM25 by large margins, they often lack exploration of the codebase and underutilize its underlying graph structure. To address this, we propose SpIDER (Spatially Informed Dense Embedding Retrieval), an enhanced dense retrieval approach that incorporates LLM-based reasoning over auxiliary context obtained through graph-based exploration of the codebase. Empirical results show that SpIDER consistently improves dense retrieval performance across several programming languages."}

Camera ready version presented at an international IEEE conference. Final version to appear in 2026", "summary": "Microservice based systems underpin modern distributed computing environments but remain vulnerable to partial failures, cascading timeouts, and inconsistent recovery behavior. Although numerous resilience and recovery patterns have been proposed, existing surveys are largely descriptive and lack systematic evidence synthesis or quantitative rigor. This paper presents a PRISMA aligned systematic literature review of empirical studies on microservice recovery strategies published between 2014 and 2025 across IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Scopus. From an initial corpus of 412 records, 26 high quality studies were selected using transparent inclusion, exclusion, and quality assessment criteria. The review identifies nine recurring resilience themes encompassing circuit breakers, retries with jitter and budgets, sagas with compensation, idempotency, bulkheads, adaptive backpressure, observability, and chaos validation. As a data oriented contribution, the paper introduces a Recovery Pattern Taxonomy, a Resilience Evaluation Score checklist for standardized benchmarking, and a constraint aware decision matrix mapping latency, consistency, and cost trade offs to appropriate recovery mechanisms. The results consolidate fragmented resilience research into a structured and analyzable evidence base that supports reproducible evaluation and informed design of fault tolerant and performance aware microservice systems."}

Existing approaches, both rule-based and learning-based, face significant limitations.

In this paper, we propose Req2LTL, a modular framework that bridges NL and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) through a hierarchical intermediate representation called OnionL. Req2LTL leverages LLMs for semantic decomposition and combines them with deterministic rule-based synthesis to ensure both syntactic validity and semantic fidelity. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that Req2LTL achieves 88.4% semantic accuracy and 100% syntactic correctness on real-world aerospace requirements, significantly outperforming existing methods."}

Efficient point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data movement, such as multicast, is essential for high performance. However, native multicast support is lacking in standard interconnect protocols. Existing P2MP solutions, such as multicast-capable Network-on-Chip (NoC), impose additional overhead to the network hardware and require modifications to the interconnect protocol, compromising scalability and compatibility.\n  This paper introduces Torrent, a novel distributed DMA architecture that enables efficient P2MP data transfers without modifying NoC hardware and interconnect protocol. Torrent conducts P2MP data transfers by forming logical chains over the NoC, where the data traverses through targeted destinations resembling a linked list. This Chainwrite mechanism preserves the P2P nature of every data transfer while enabling flexible data transfers to an unlimited number of destinations. To optimize the performance and energy consumption of Chainwrite, two scheduling algorithms are developed to determine the optimal chain order based on NoC topology.\n  Our RTL and FPGA prototype evaluations using both synthetic and real workloads demonstrate significant advantages in performance, flexibility, and scalability over network-layer multicast. Compared to the unicast baseline, Torrent achieves up to a 7.88x speedup. ASIC synthesis on 16nm technology confirms the architecture's minimal footprint in area (1.2%) and power (2.3%). Thanks to the Chainwrite, Torrent delivers scalable P2MP data transfers with a small cycle overhead of 82CC and area overhead of 207um2 per destination."}

This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations."}

However, existing AIGC services typically operate within a centralized framework, resulting in high response times. To address this issue, we integrate collaborative Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technology to reduce processing delays for AIGC services. Current collaborative MEC methods primarily support single-server offloading or facilitate interactions among fixed Edge Servers (ESs), limiting flexibility and resource utilization across all ESs to meet the varying computing and networking requirements of AIGC services. We propose AMCoEdge, an adaptive multi-server collaborative MEC approach to enhancing AIGC service efficiency. The AMCoEdge fully utilizes the computing and networking resources across all ESs through adaptive multi-ES selection and dynamic workload allocation, thereby minimizing the offloading make-span of AIGC services. Our design features an online distributed algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, accompanied by theoretical analyses that confirm an approximate linear time complexity. Simulation results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving at least an 11.04% reduction in task offloading make-span and a 44.86% decrease in failure rate. Additionally, we develop a distributed prototype system to implement and evaluate our AMCoEdge method for real AIGC service execution, demonstrating service delays that are 9.23% - 31.98% lower than the three representative methods."}

However, little is known about how developers actually use TEEs in practice. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of real-world TEE applications. We collected and analyzed 241 open-source projects from GitHub that utilize the two most widely-adopted TEEs, Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone. By combining manual inspection with customized static analysis scripts, we examined their adoption contexts, usage patterns, and development practices across three phases. First, we categorized the projects into 8 application domains and identified trends in TEE adoption over time. We found that the dominant use case is IoT device security (30%), which contrasts sharply with prior academic focus on blockchain and cryptographic systems (7%), while AI model protection (12%) is rapidly emerging as a growing domain. Second, we analyzed how TEEs are integrated into software and observed that 32.4% of the projects reimplement cryptographic functionalities instead of using official SDK APIs, suggesting that current SDKs may have limited usability and portability to meet developers' practical needs. Third, we examined security practices through manual inspection and found that 25.3% (61 of 241) of the projects exhibit insecure coding behaviors when using TEEs, such as hardcoded secrets and missing input validation, which undermine their intended security guarantees. Our findings have important implications for improving the usability of TEE SDKs and supporting developers in trusted software development."}

Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games."}

A fundamental trade-off arises between the timeliness of the information maintained at the AP and the update cost incurred at the device. To address this trade-off, we propose an online algorithm that determines when to transmit updates using only available observations. The proposed algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal competitive ratio against an adversary that can simultaneously manipulate multiple sources of uncertainty, including the operation duration, the information staleness, the update cost, and the availability of update opportunities. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning (ML) advice of unknown reliability into the design, we develop an ML-augmented algorithm that asymptotically attains the optimal consistency-robustness trade-off, even when the adversary can additionally corrupt the ML advice. The optimal competitive ratio scales linearly with the range of update costs, but is unaffected by other uncertainties. Moreover, an optimal competitive online algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to the ML advice: it either fully trusts or completely ignores the ML advice, as partially trusting the advice cannot improve the consistency without severely degrading the robustness. Extensive simulations in stochastic settings further validate the theoretical findings in the adversarial environment."}

However, these efforts remain limited by manual curation, static datasets, and a focus on Python-based bug fixes. We introduce SWE-Bench++, an automated framework that generates repository-level coding tasks from open-source GitHub projects. Unlike synthetic approaches, our pipeline harvests live pull requests to cover both bug fixes and feature requests across 11 languages. SWE-Bench++ turns GitHub pull requests (PRs) into reproducible, execution-based tasks via four stages: programmatic sourcing, environment synthesis, test oracle extraction, and quality assurance. A final hint-guided trajectory synthesis step converts instances that strong models fail on into training trajectories. Our initial benchmark consists of 11,133 instances from 3,971 repositories across 11 languages. On a subset of 1,782 instances of this benchmark, today's strongest models perform as follows: claude-sonnet-4.5 achieves 36.20% pass@10, gpt-5-2025-08-07 34.57%, gemini/gemini-2.5-pro 24.92%, and gpt-4o 16.89%. We further demonstrate the utility of our dataset by showing that fine-tuning on SWE-Bench++ instances yields measurable improvements on the SWE-bench Multilingual benchmark. SWE-Bench++ provides a scalable, multilingual benchmark for evaluating and improving repository-level code generation."}

However, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new risks to survey integrity, as participants can use generative tools to fabricate or manipulate their responses. This study explores how LLMs are being misused in software engineering surveys and investigates the methodological implications of such behavior for data authenticity, validity, and research integrity. We collected data from two survey deployments conducted in 2025 through the Prolific platform and analyzed the content of participants' answers to identify irregular or falsified responses. A subset of responses suspected of being AI generated was examined through qualitative pattern inspection, narrative characterization, and automated detection using the Scribbr AI Detector. The analysis revealed recurring structural patterns in 49 survey responses indicating synthetic authorship, including repetitive sequencing, uniform phrasing, and superficial personalization. These false narratives mimicked coherent reasoning while concealing fabricated content, undermining construct, internal, and external validity. Our study identifies data authenticity as an emerging dimension of validity in software engineering surveys. We emphasize that reliable evidence now requires combining automated and interpretive verification procedures, transparent reporting, and community standards to detect and prevent AI generated responses, thereby protecting the credibility of surveys in software engineering."}

While these stages enhance capability, they introduce significant system bottlenecks. First, multimodal preprocessing-especially video decoding-often dominates Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). Most systems rely on CPU-based decoding, which severely limits throughput, while existing GPU-based approaches prioritize throughput-oriented parallelism and fail to meet the latency-sensitive requirements of MLLM inference. Second, the vision encoder is a standalone, compute-intensive stage that produces visual embeddings and cannot be co-batched with LLM prefill or decoding. This heterogeneity forces inter-stage blocking and increases token-generation latency. Even when deployed on separate GPUs, these stages underutilize available compute and memory resources, reducing overall utilization and constraining system throughput.\n  To address these challenges, we present FlashCodec and UnifiedServe, two complementary designs that jointly optimize the end-to-end MLLM pipeline. FlashCodec accelerates the multimodal preprocessing stage through collaborative multi-GPU video decoding, reducing decoding latency while preserving high throughput. UnifiedServe optimizes the vision-to-text and inference stages using a logically decoupled their execution to eliminate inter-stage blocking, yet physically sharing GPU resources to maximize GPU system utilization. By carefully orchestrating execution across stages and minimizing interference, UnifiedServe Together, our proposed framework forms an end-to-end optimized stack that can serve up to 3.0$\\times$ more requests or enforce 1.5$\\times$ tighter SLOs, while achieving up to 4.4$\\times$ higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems."}

Prior research has typically examined single issues such as class imbalance or feature irrelevance in isolation, overlooking that real-world data problems frequently co-occur and interact. This study presents, to our knowledge, the first large-scale empirical analysis in SDP that simultaneously examines five co-occurring data quality issues (class imbalance, class overlap, irrelevant features, attribute noise, and outliers) across 374 datasets and five classifiers. We employ Explainable Boosting Machines together with stratified interaction analysis to quantify both direct and conditional effects under default hyperparameter settings, reflecting practical baseline usage.\n  Our results show that co-occurrence is nearly universal: even the least frequent issue (attribute noise) appears alongside others in more than 93% of datasets. Irrelevant features and imbalance are nearly ubiquitous, while class overlap is the most consistently harmful issue. We identify stable tipping points around 0.20 for class overlap, 0.65-0.70 for imbalance, and 0.94 for irrelevance, beyond which most models begin to degrade. We also uncover counterintuitive patterns, such as outliers improving performance when irrelevant features are low, underscoring the importance of context-aware evaluation. Finally, we expose a performance-robustness trade-off: no single learner dominates under all conditions.\n  By jointly analyzing prevalence, co-occurrence, thresholds, and conditional effects, our study directly addresses a persistent gap in SDP research. Hence, moving beyond isolated analyses to provide a holistic, data-aware understanding of how quality issues shape model performance in real-world settings."}

Understanding Smart Contract Semantics and Interactions in the NFT Ecosystem", "comment": null, "summary": "The NFT ecosystem represents an interconnected, decentralized environment that encompasses the creation, distribution, and trading of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), where key actors, such as marketplaces, sellers, and buyers, utilize smart contracts to facilitate secure, transparent, and trustless transactions. Scam tokens are deliberately created to mislead users and facilitate financial exploitation, posing significant risks in the NFT ecosystem. Prior work has explored the NFT ecosystem from various perspectives, including security challenges, actor behaviors, and risks from scams and wash trading, leaving a gap in understanding the semantics and interactions of smart contracts during transactions, and how the risks associated with scam tokens manifest in relation to the semantics and interactions of contracts. To bridge this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on smart contract semantics and interactions in the NFT ecosystem, using a curated dataset of nearly 100 million transactions across 20 million blocks on Ethereum. We observe a limited semantic diversity among smart contracts in the NFT ecosystem, dominated by proxy, token, and DeFi contracts. Marketplace and proxy registry contracts are the most frequently involved in smart contract interactions during transactions, engaging with a broad spectrum of contracts in the ecosystem. Token contracts exhibit bytecode-level diversity, whereas scam tokens exhibit bytecode convergence. Certain interaction patterns between smart contracts are common to both risky and non-risky transactions, while others are predominantly associated with risky transactions. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to mitigate risks in the blockchain ecosystem, and outline future research directions."}

Efficient point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data movement, such as multicast, is essential for high performance. However, native multicast support is lacking in standard interconnect protocols. Existing P2MP solutions, such as multicast-capable Network-on-Chip (NoC), impose additional overhead to the network hardware and require modifications to the interconnect protocol, compromising scalability and compatibility.\n  This paper introduces Torrent, a novel distributed DMA architecture that enables efficient P2MP data transfers without modifying NoC hardware and interconnect protocol. Torrent conducts P2MP data transfers by forming logical chains over the NoC, where the data traverses through targeted destinations resembling a linked list. This Chainwrite mechanism preserves the P2P nature of every data transfer while enabling flexible data transfers to an unlimited number of destinations. To optimize the performance and energy consumption of Chainwrite, two scheduling algorithms are developed to determine the optimal chain order based on NoC topology.\n  Our RTL and FPGA prototype evaluations using both synthetic and real workloads demonstrate significant advantages in performance, flexibility, and scalability over network-layer multicast. Compared to the unicast baseline, Torrent achieves up to a 7.88x speedup. ASIC synthesis on 16nm technology confirms the architecture's minimal footprint in area (1.2%) and power (2.3%). Thanks to the Chainwrite, Torrent delivers scalable P2MP data transfers with a small cycle overhead of 82CC and area overhead of 207um2 per destination."}

To address this, we propose Specification-Grounded Code Review (SGCR), a framework that grounds LLMs in human-authored specifications to produce trustworthy and relevant feedback. SGCR features a novel dual-pathway architecture: an explicit path ensures deterministic compliance with predefined rules derived from these specifications, while an implicit path heuristically discovers and verifies issues beyond those rules. Deployed in a live industrial environment at HiThink Research, SGCR's suggestions achieved a 42% developer adoption rate-a 90.9% relative improvement over a baseline LLM (22%). Our work demonstrates that specification-grounding is a powerful paradigm for bridging the gap between the generative power of LLMs and the rigorous reliability demands of software engineering."}

While previous research has focused mostly on chain-based scheduling with ad-hoc response time analyses, we propose a novel approach using the events executor to implement fixed-job-level-priority schedulers for arbitrary ROS2 graphs on uniprocessor systems. We demonstrate that ROS 2 applications can be abstracted as forests of trees, enabling the mapping of ROS 2 applications to traditional real-time DAG task models. Our usage of the events executor requires a special implementation of the events queue and a communication middleware that supports LIFO-ordered message delivery, features not yet standard in ROS2. We show that our implementation generates the same schedules as a conventional fixed-priority DAG task scheduler, in spite of lacking access to the precedence information that usually is required. This further closes the gap between established real-time systems theory and ROS2 scheduling analyses."}
