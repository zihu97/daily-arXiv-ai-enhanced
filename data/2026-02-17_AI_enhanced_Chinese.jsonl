Many mitigation techniques have been introduced to address Rowhammer, with some support being incorporated into the JEDEC DDR5 standard for per-row-activation-counter (PRAC) and refresh-management (RFM) systems. Mitigation schemes built on these mechanisms claim to have various levels of area, power, and performance overheads. To date the evaluation of existing mitigation schemes typically neglects the impact of other memory system components such as hardware prefetchers. Nearly all modern systems incorporate hardware prefetching and these can significantly improve processor performance through speculative cache population. These prefetchers induce higher numbers of downstream memory requests and increase DRAM activation rates. The performance overhead of Rowhammer mitigations are tied directly to memory access patterns, exposing both hardware prefetchers and Rowhammer mitigations to cross-interaction. We find that the performance improvement provided by prior-work hardware prefetchers is often severely impacted by Rowhammer mitigations. In effect, much of the benefit of speculative memory references from prefetching lies in accelerating and reordering DRAM references in ways that trigger mitigations, significantly reducing the benefits of prefetching. This work proposes the Optimized Row Access Prefetcher (ORAP), leveraging last-level-cache (LLC) space to cache large portions of DRAM rowbuffer contents to reduce the need for future activations. Working with the state-of-the-art Berti prefetcher, ORAP reduces DRAM activation rates by 51.3% and achieves a 4.6% speedup over the prefetcher configuration of Berti and SPP-PPF when prefetching in an RFM-mitigated memory system. Under PRAC mitigations, ORAP reduces energy overheads by 11.8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793aRowhammer\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u9884\u53d6\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u51faORAP\u9884\u53d6\u5668\u51cf\u5c11DRAM\u884c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Rowhammer\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\u8bc4\u4f30\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u9884\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9884\u53d6\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u5b58\u8bf7\u6c42\u91cf\u53cd\u800c\u89e6\u53d1\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\u6536\u76ca\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4ea4\u53c9\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u8bbf\u95ee\u9884\u53d6\u5668\uff08ORAP\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u672b\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u4e2d\u5b58\u50a8DRAM\u884c\u7f13\u51b2Japanese content\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u884c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u914d\u5408Berti\u9884\u53d6\u5668\u5728RFM/PRAC\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "RFM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dORAP\u964d\u4f4e51.3%\u884c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7387\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53474.6%\uff1bPRAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e11.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "ORAP\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u5b58\u884c\u5185\u5bb9\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u9884\u53d6\u4f18\u5316\u4e0eRowhammer\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7f13\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6548\u3002"}}

Moreover, the utilized memristor framework was experimentally pre-validated with the experimental data of Y2O3-based memristive devices, which shows significantly low values of variability during switching in both device-to-device (D2D) and cycle-to-cycle (C2C) operation. The performance metrics were calculated in terms of area, power, and delay of these sequential circuits and were found to be reduced by more than ~24%, 60%, and 58%, respectively, as compared to the other state-of-the-art work on sequential circuits.

The formulation captures fixed routings and designated machines, explicit resource calendars with weekends and planned maintenance, and campaign sequencing through sequence-dependent cleaning times derived from site tables. The model is implemented with an open source constraint solver and evaluated on deterministic snapshots from a solid oral dosage facility under three objective formulations: makespan, makespan plus total tardiness, and makespan plus average tardiness. On three industrial instances of increasing size (10, 30, and 84 jobs) the proposed schedules dominate reference plans that solve a simplified variant without the added site rules. Makespan reductions reach \\(88.1\\%\\), \\(77.6\\%\\), and \\(54.9\\%\\) and total tardiness reductions reach \\(72.1\\%\\), \\(58.7\\%\\), and \\(18.2\\%\\), respectively.

The centralized, deterministic scheduling model suffers from $O(N)$ latency scaling, \"Head-of-Line\" blocking, and thermodynamic blindness, rendering it incapable of managing the stochastic chaos of next-generation AI workloads. This paper proposes a paradigm shift from orchestration to Thermodynamic Governance. We model the compute cluster not as a static state machine, but as a Dissipative Structure far from equilibrium. We introduce TEG (Thermo-Economic Governor), a decentralized architecture that establishes a rigorous topological isomorphism between cluster resource contention and many-body physics. TEG replaces the global scheduler with Langevin Agents that execute Brownian motion on a Holographic Potential Field, reducing decision complexity to $O(1)$. System stability is maintained via a macro-scale Landau Phase Transition mechanism, which modulates global damping (taxation) to physically dissolve deadlocks. Crucially, we enforce Token Evaporation to mirror entropy dissipation, preventing economic inflation and ensuring an open thermodynamic system. We provide formal theoretical analysis proving that: (1) The system converges asymptotically to a Nash Equilibrium via Dual-Number Damping; (2) OOM catastrophic failures are converted into manageable Glassy States via an OS-level Airlock Mutex; and (3) Safety is mathematically guaranteed under high inertia using High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBF). TEG demonstrates that emergent order, rather than deterministic control, is the necessary condition for Exascale scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9Exascale\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u7f16\u6392\u8f6c\u5411\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6cbb\u7406\u8303\u5f0f(TEG)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u8d44\u6e90\u7ade\u4e89\u4e0e\u591a\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u540c\u6784\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u963b\u585e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dKubernetes\u7b49\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f16\u6392\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34O(N)\u7ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u957f Sounds\u3001\u5934\u90e8\u963b\u585e\u53ca\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u76f2\u533a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6df7\u6c8c\uff1b\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u541110^5+\u8282\u70b9\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u5ea6\u906d\u9047\u7269\u7406\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6cbb\u7406\u67b6\u6784TEG\uff1a1) \u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u96c6\u7fa4\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u8017\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2) \u7528Langevin\u4ee3\u7406\u53d6\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u52bf\u80fd\u573a\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8(O(1)\u590d\u6742\u5ea6)\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u53d8\u673a\u5236\u8c03\u63a7\u5168\u5c40\u963b\u5c3c\u5316\u89e3\u6b7b\u9501\uff1b4) \u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u8bc1\u84b8\u53d1\u4fdd\u6301\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6570\u963b\u5c3c\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff1bOOM\u6545\u969c\u88ab\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u50f5\u6ede\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u9ad8\u9636\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\u4fdd\u969c\u9ad8\u60ef\u6027\u4e0b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "con echosion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTEG\u901a\u8fc7\u6d8c\u73b0\u79e9\u5e8f\u66ff\u4ee3\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3aExascale\u7ea7\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8d85\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), a growing body of work has explored automated support for code review. However, progress in this area is hindered by the lack of a systematic understanding of existing benchmarks and evaluation practices. Current code review datasets are scattered, vary widely in design, and provide limited insight into what review capabilities are actually being assessed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of code review benchmarks spanning both the Pre-LLM and LLM eras (2015--2025). We analyze 99 research papers (58 Pre-LLM era and 41 LLM era) and extract key metadata, including datasets, evaluation metrics, data sources, and target tasks. Based on this analysis, we propose a multi-level taxonomy that organizes code review research into five domains and 18 fine-grained tasks. Our study reveals a clear shift toward end-to-end generative peer review, increasing multilingual coverage, and a decline in standalone change understanding tasks. We further identify limitations of current benchmarks and outline future directions, including broader task coverage, dynamic runtime evaluation, and taxonomy-guided fine-grained assessment.

However, in real-world edge environments, collaborative multimodal learning is challenged by modality heterogeneity (different modality combinations across domains) and model-structure heterogeneity (different modality-specific encoders/fusion modules. To address these issues, we propose ML-ECS, a collaborative multimodal learning framework that enables joint training between a server-based model and heterogeneous edge models. This framework consists of four components: (1) cross-modal contrastive learning (CCL) to align modality representations in a shared latent space, (2) adaptive multimodal tuning (AMT) to preserve domain-specific knowledge from local datasets, (3) modality-aware model aggregation (MMA) to robustly aggregate while mitigating noise caused by missing modalities, and (4) SLM-enhanced CCL (SE-CCL) to facilitate bidirectional knowledge transfer between cloud and edge. Experimental results on various multimodal tasks show that \\pname consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines under varying modality availability, achieving improvements of 5.44% to 12.08% in Rouge-LSum and improving both client- and server-side performance.

However, most existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions, such as a fixed number of agents and fully synchronous action execution. These assumptions are often violated in urban systems, where the number of active agents varies over time, and actions may have heterogeneous durations, resulting in a semi-MARL setting. Moreover, while sharing policy parameters among agents is commonly adopted to improve learning efficiency, it can lead to highly homogeneous actions when a subset of agents make decisions concurrently under similar observations, potentially degrading coordination quality. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Value Decomposition (AVD), a cooperative MARL framework that adapts to a dynamically changing agent population. AVD further incorporates a lightweight mechanism to mitigate action homogenization induced by shared policies, thereby encouraging behavioral diversity and maintaining effective cooperation among agents. In addition, we design a training-execution strategy tailored to the semi-MARL setting that accommodates asynchronous decision-making when some agents act at different times. Experiments on real-world bike-sharing redistribution tasks in two major cities, London and Washington, D.C., demonstrate that AVD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u503c\u5206\u89e3(AVD)\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u57ce\u5e02\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u5355\u8f66\u518d\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u540c\u8d28\u5316\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u534f\u8c03\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "AVD\u6846\u67b6\u9002\u5e94\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u673a\u5236\u7f13\u89e3\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u540c\u8d28\u5316\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3a Kremlin\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u534f\u4f5c\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3-\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u534aMARL\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f26\u6566\u548c\u534e\u76db\u987f\u7279\u533a\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u5355\u8f66\u518d\u5206\u914d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AVD\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While directed fuzzing effectively drives path exploration, satisfying complex semantic constraints remains a persistent bottleneck in automated exploit generation. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their semantic reasoning capabilities; however, existing LLM-based approaches lack sufficient grounding in concrete execution behavior, limiting their ability to generate precise PoVs.\n  In this paper, we present DrillAgent, an agentic framework that reformulates PoV generation as an iterative hypothesis-verification-refinement process. To bridge the gap between static reasoning and dynamic execution, DrillAgent synergizes LLM-based semantic inference with feedback from concrete program states. The agent analyzes the target code to hypothesize inputs, observes execution behavior, and employs a novel mechanism to translate low-level execution traces into source-level constraints. This closed-loop design enables the agent to incrementally align its input generation with the precise requirements of the vulnerability. We evaluate DrillAgent on SEC-bench, a large-scale benchmark of real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that DrillAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM agent baselines under fixed budget constraints, solving up to 52.8% more CVE tasks than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight the necessity of execution-state-aware reasoning for reliable PoV generation in complex software systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These interactions give rise to dynamic multiplex UAV networks, where each layer represents a distinct type of interaction among UAVs. Understanding how such links form and evolve is both of theoretical interest and of practical importance for the control and maintenance of networked UAV systems. In this paper, we first develop a dynamic multiplex network model for UAV networks to characterize their dynamic and heterogeneous link properties. We then propose a cross-layer fusion-based deep learning model, termed CLF-ULP, to predict future inter-UAV links based on historical topology data. CLF-ULP incorporates graph attention networks to extract topological features within each layer and perform a cross-layer attention fusion to capture inter-layer dependencies.

The development process of PSCs is precise and complex, involving a series of closed-loop workflows such as literature retrieval, data integration, experimental design, and synthesis. However, existing AI perovskite approaches focus predominantly on discrete models, including material design, process optimization,and property prediction. These models fail to propagate physical constraints across the workflow, hindering end-to-end optimization. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system for perovskite material discovery, named PeroMAS. We first encapsulated a series of perovskite-specific tools into Model Context Protocols (MCPs). By planning and invoking these tools, PeroMAS can design perovskite materials under multi-objective constraints, covering the entire process from literature retrieval and data extraction to property prediction and mechanism analysis. Furthermore, we construct an evaluation benchmark by perovskite human experts to assess this multi-agent system. Results demonstrate that, compared to single Large Language Model (LLM) or traditional search strategies, our system significantly enhances discovery efficiency.

Specifically, existing systems overlook the interleaved prefill-decode workload pattern in multi-round inference, leading to sub-optimal handling of the incremental prefill workloads and model deployment for the two phases.\n  In this work, we present AMPD, a brand new disaggregated serving framework for multi-round LLM inference. The core of AMPD is to coordinate the prefill workloads based on real-time workloads by adaptively determining where to carry out these workloads and how they are scheduled, in order to maximize service level objective (SLO) attainment.

However, these benchmarks predominantly focus on implementation, overlooking the equally critical aspect of software design. This gap raises two pivotal questions: (1) Can LLMs handle software design? (2) Can LLMs write code following the specific designs? To investigate these questions, this paper proposes DesBench, a design-aware benchmark for evaluating LLMs on three software design-related tasks: design-aware code generation, object-oriented modeling, and the design of acceptance test cases. DesBench comprises 30 manually crafted Java projects that include requirement documents, design models, implementations, and acceptance tests, amounting to a total of 30 design models, 194 Java classes, and 737 test cases. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including three DeepSeek R1, two Qwen2.5, and two GPT models, using DesBench. The results reveal that LLMs remain significantly challenged by the intricacies of software design: (1) For code generation, LLMs struggle to produce correct implementations when provided with only high-level or no designs. (2) In object-oriented modeling, while LLMs can accurately identify objects and classes, they face challenges in defining operations and inter-class relationships. (3) Acceptance test cases generated by LLMs from functional requirements achieve code coverage quality comparable to those written by humans.

The combination of these two elements yields a new and more general equilibrium concept, which we term the mean-field risk-averse quantal response equilibrium (MF-RQE). We establish existence results and prove convergence of fixed-point iteration and fictitious play to MF-RQE. Building on these insights, we develop a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm for scenarios with large state-action spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate that MF-RQE policies achieve improved robustness relative to classical mean-field approaches that optimize expected cumulative rewards under a fixed initial distribution and are restricted to entropy-based regularizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, an SBOM often contain sensitive information that organizations are unwilling to disclose in full to anyone, for two main concerns: technological risks deriving from exposing proprietary dependencies or unpatched vulnerabilities, and business risks, deriving from exposing architectural strategies. Therefore, delivering a plaintext SBOM may result in the disruption of the intellectual property of a company. To address this, we present VeriSBOM, a trustless, selectively disclosed SBOM framework that provides cryptographic verifiability of SBOMs using zero-knowledge proofs. Within VeriSBOM, third parties can validate specific statements about a delivered software. Respectively, VeriSBOM allows independent third parties to verify if a software contains authentic dependencies distributed by official package managers and that the same dependencies satisfy rigorous policy constraints such as the absence of vulnerable dependencies or the adherence with specific licenses models. VeriSBOM leverages a scalable vector commitment scheme together with folding-based proof aggregation to produce succinct zero-knowledge proofs that attest to security and compliance properties while preserving confidentiality. Crucially, the verification process requires no trust in the SBOM publisher beyond the soundness of the underlying primitives, and third parties can independently check proofs against the public cryptographic commitments. We implement VeriSBOM, analyze its security, and evaluate its performance on real-world package registries. The results show that our method enables scalable, privacy-preserving, and verifiable SBOM sharing and validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

High-level intents, such as latency minimization, energy balancing, or coverage prioritization, are explicitly modeled and incorporated into a generative diffusion planning process that produces feasible and adaptive data collection trajectories.

Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework against conventional path-planning baselines.

These problems, which pose major risks to network performance, include flooding, sinkholes, and black hole assaults to address these challenges. We introduce the Hybrid Secure Routing Protocol (HSRP), which enhances the security and robustness of routing operations by fusing trust-based tactics with cryptographic approaches. HSRP combines the strengths of both proactive and reactive routing strategies, enabling it to adapt dynamically to evolving network conditions while protecting against malicious activities. We use extensive simulations with Network Simulator (NS-2) and a thorough review of the literature to assess HSRP's performance under different attack scenarios.

This is exacerbated when dealing with cognitive agent models, such as the Belief Desire Intention (BDI) model, where the agent codebase is not suitable to run unchanged in simulation environments, thus increasing the reality gap between the deployed and simulated systems.

The major spatial approaches include federated tuning, mixture of experts, patch-based diffusion, and hierarchical diffusion. Meanwhile, the important temporal approaches encompass split learning, cascading inference, speculative decoding, and routing inference.

In this work, we propose a proactive safety-constrained RL framework that integrates proof-carrying control (PCC) with empowerment-budgeted (EB) enforcement.

We propose a governance architecture that separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains and models autonomy as a vector of sovereignty. Cognitive autonomy remains unconstrained, while selection and action autonomy are bounded through mechanically enforced primitives operating outside the agent's optimization space. The architecture integrates external candidate generation (CEFL), a governed reducer, commit-reveal entropy isolation, rationale validation, and fail-loud circuit breakers. We evaluate the system across multiple regulated financial scenarios under adversarial stress targeting variance manipulation, threshold gaming, framing skew, ordering effects, and entropy probing. Metrics quantify selection concentration, narrative diversity, governance activation cost, and failure visibility. Results show that mechanical selection governance is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while preserving reasoning capacity.

Five ACSL generation systems are compared: a rule-based Python script, Frama-C's RTE plugin, and three large language models--DeepSeek-V3.2, GPT-5.2, and OLMo 3.1 32B Instruct. All generated specifications are verified under identical conditions using the Frama-C WP plugin powered by multiple SMT solvers, allowing a direct comparison of annotation quality, solver sensitivity, and proof stability. Our results provide new empirical evidence on the capabilities and limitations of automated ACSL generation, complementing prior survey-based work.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Meanwhile, evaluating the freshness of multimodal data is essential, as stale updates would delay task execution, degrade decision accuracy, and undermine safety in latency-sensitive services. However, existing freshness metrics such as Age of Information (AoI) are not suitable for multimodal data, as they do not capture modality-specific characteristics. In this paper, we propose a metric, namely, Modality-Tailored Age of Information (MAoI), to provide a unified and decision-relevant evaluation of freshness for resource management and policy optimization for multimodal data. This metric integrates modality-specific semantic and temporal characteristics, reflecting both age evolution and content importance for multimodal data in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems. Then, the closed-form expression of the average MAoI is derived, and an MAoI minimization problem is formulated, where sampling intervals and offloading decisions are optimized with practical energy constraints. To effectively solve this problem, a Joint Sampling Offloading Optimization (JSO) algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the sampling intervals and offloading decisions. It is a block coordinate descent-based algorithm where an optimal sampling-interval subalgorithm is used to update the sampling intervals, and an interference-aware best-response offloading subalgorithm is proposed to update the offloading decisions alternately. Finally, a comprehensive simulation is performed, confirming that the MAoI metric effectively quantifies multimodal freshness compared to traditional AoI, and the JSO algorithm significantly minimizes the average MAoI compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We identify six components of tool descriptions from the literature, develop a scoring rubric utilizing these components, then formalize tool description smells based on this rubric.

Conventional approaches struggle to detect the subtle, early stages of intent drift, raising alarms only when degradation is significant and failure is imminent, which limits their effectiveness for proactive assurance. To address this, we propose LEAD-Drift, a framework that detects intent drift in real time to enable proactive failure prevention. LEAD-Drift's core contribution is reformulating intent failure detection as a supervised learning problem by training a lightweight neural network on fixed-horizon labels to predict a future risk score. The model's raw output is then smoothed with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and passed through a statistically tuned threshold to generate robust, real-time alerts. Furthermore, we enhance the framework with two key features for operational intelligence: a multi-horizon modeling technique for dynamic time-to-failure estimation, and per-alert explainability using SHAP to identify root-cause KPIs. Our evaluation on a time-series dataset shows LEAD-Drift provides significantly earlier warnings, improving the average lead time by 7.3 minutes (+17.8\\%) compared to a distance-based baseline. It also reduces alert noise by 80.2\\% compared to a weighted-KPI heuristic, with only a minor trade-off in lead time. These results demonstrate that LEAD-Drift as a highly effective, interpretable, and operationally efficient solution for proactive network assurance in IBN.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This article proposes \\textit{Agent-OSI}, a six-layer reference stack for decentralized agent networking built on top of the existing Internet. Agent-OSI combines secure connectivity and A2A messaging, decentralized identity and authorization, settlement and metering, verifiable execution and provenance, and semantic interoperability for orchestration. In particular, we treat HTTP 402 (Payment Required) as an application-level payment challenge (analogous to HTTP 401 for authentication) that triggers escrow-based settlement and verifiable receipts (instantiated via a blockchain escrow in our prototype), rather than introducing a new network-layer protocol. We implement a prototype and evaluate cost and latency. Results show that keeping negotiation and delivery off-chain while preserving verifiable settlement reduces on-chain session costs by approximately 51\\% compared with a standard Web3 baseline in our prototype setting, and that blockchain confirmation latency is often not the dominant factor for generative workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Enterprise networks are often managed locally, where expertise is scarce. Existing research has focused on creating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLMs that can help to plan and configure RAN and core aspects only. Co-management of RAN and edge AI is the gap, which creates hierarchical and dynamic problems that require turn-based human interactions. Here, we create an agentic network manager and turn-based conversation assistant that can understand human intent-based queries that match hierarchical problems in AI-RAN. The framework constructed consists of: (a) a user interface and evaluation dashboard, (b) an intelligence layer that interfaces with the AI-RAN, and (c) a knowledge layer for providing the basis for evaluations and recommendations. These form 3 layers of capability with the following validation performances (average response time 13s): (1) design and planning a service (78\\% accuracy), (2) operating specific AI-RAN tools (89\\% accuracy), and (3) tuning AI-RAN performance (67\\%).

Multiple control loops coexist across the service management layer and RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), while independently developed control applications can interact in unintended ways. In parallel, recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) are enabling a shift from isolated AI models toward agentic AI systems that can interpret goals, coordinate multiple models and control functions, and adapt their behavior over time. This article proposes a multi-scale agentic AI framework for O-RAN that organizes RAN intelligence as a coordinated hierarchy across the Non-Real-Time (Non-RT), Near-Real-Time (Near-RT), and Real-Time (RT) control loops: (i) A Large Language Model (LLM) agent in the Non-RT RIC translates operator intent into policies and governs model lifecycles. (ii) Small Language Model (SLM) agents in the Near-RT RIC execute low-latency optimization and can activate, tune, or disable existing control applications; and (iii) Wireless Physical-layer Foundation Model (WPFM) agents near the distributed unit provide fast inference close to the air interface. We describe how these agents cooperate through standardized O-RAN interfaces and telemetry. Using a proof-of-concept implementation built on open-source models, software, and datasets, we demonstrate the proposed agentic approach in two representative scenarios: robust operation under non-stationary conditions and intent-driven slice resource control.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Service function chaining (SFC) requires continuously placing and scheduling virtual network functions (VNFs) chains under compute/bandwidth and end-to-end QoS constraints. Most SFC optimizers assume static or stationary networks, and degrade under long-term topology/resource changes (failures, upgrades, expansions) that induce non-stationary graph drifts. We propose LiSFC, a Lipschitz lifelong planner that transfers MCTS statistics across drifting network configurations using an MDP-distance bound. More precisely, we formulate the problem as a sequence of MDPs indexed by the underlying network graph and constraints, and we define a \\emph{graph drift} metric that upper-bounds the LiZero MDP distance. This allows LiSFC to import theoretical guarantees on bias and sample efficiency from the LiZero framework while being tailored to cloud-network convergence. We then design \\emph{LiSFC-Search}, an SFC-aware unified MCTS (UMCTS) procedure that uses transferable adaptive UCT (aUCT) bonuses to reuse search statistics from prior CPN configurations. Preliminary results on synthetic CPN topologies and SFC workloads show that LiSFC consistently reduces SFC blocking probability and improves tail delay compared to non-transfer MCTS and purely learning-based baselines, highlighting its potential as an AI/ML building block for cloud-network convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present the first longitudinal study of Bitcoin's resilience to infrastructure failures using 11 years of P2P network data (2014-2025), 658 submarine cables, and 68 verified cable fault events. Using a Buldyrev-style cascade model with a country-level physical layer (225 countries, 354 submarine cable edges, 325 land border edges), we find that Bitcoin's clearnet percolation threshold $p_c \\approx 0.72$-$0.92$ for random cable failures, declining 22% from $p_c \\approx 0.92$ (2014-2017) to a minimum of $p_c = 0.72$ in 2021 during peak mining concentration. Targeted attacks reduce $p_c$ to 0.05-0.20. To address the 64% of nodes using Tor with unobservable locations, we develop a 4-layer multiplex model incorporating Tor relay infrastructure. Tor relay bandwidth concentrates in well-connected European countries, increasing resilience by $\u0394p_c \\approx +0.02$-$+0.10$ rather than introducing fragility. Empirical validation shows 87% of cable faults caused less than 5% node impact. We contribute: (1) a multiplex percolation framework for overlay-underlay coupling with a 4-layer Tor relay model; (2) the first empirical measurement of Bitcoin's physical-layer resilience over a decade; and (3) evidence that Tor adoption amplifies resilience with distributional bounds under partial observability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
