With this change of paradigm, we remove many restrictions previously enforced to allow provable performance. Most notability, while maintaining the core behaviour of GCS, we: 1. Lift the requirement for unitary link lengths and thereby create a realistic model for flexible deployment of implementations of GCS in practice. 2. Provide a formal model of frequency sources assumed in prior work. 3. Perform a fine grained distinction between the different components of the algorithm's estimation error and globally reduce its impact by multiple orders of magnitude. 4. Significantly reduce the contribution of the uncertainty to the algorithm's estimation error to be in the range of 10\\% to 0,1\\% of the delay per link instead of being in the oder of the delay per link as in prior work and show matching upper bounds on the local and global skew of GCS."}

As these workloads run in heterogeneous environments such as the Edge-Cloud-Space 3D Continuum, they often require intensive parallel computation, which GPUs can perform far more efficiently than CPUs. However, current platforms struggle to manage hardware acceleration effectively, as static user-device assignments fail to ensure SLO compliance under varying loads or placements, and one-time dynamic selections often lead to suboptimal or cost-inefficient configurations. To address these issues, we present Gaia, a GPU-as-a-service model and architecture that makes hardware acceleration a platform concern. Gaia combines (i) a lightweight Execution Mode Identifier that inspects function code at deploy time to emit one of four execution modes, and a Dynamic Function Runtime that continuously reevaluates user-defined SLOs to promote or demote between CPU- and GPU backends. Our evaluation shows that it seamlessly selects the best hardware acceleration for the workload, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 95%. These results indicate that Gaia enables SLO-aware, cost-efficient acceleration for serverless AI across heterogeneous environments."}

This paper presents its design principles, overall structure, and the key compiler transformations required to support SIMT execution on Vortex. VOLT enables SIMT code generation and optimization across multiple levels of abstraction through a hierarchical design that accommodates diverse front-end languages and open GPU hardware. To ensure extensibility as GPU architectures evolve, VOLT centralizes fundamental SIMT-related analyses and optimizations in the middle-end, allowing them to be reused across front-ends and easily adapted to emerging open-GPU variants. Through two case studies on ISA extensions and host-runtime API, this paper also demonstrates how VOLT can support extensions"}

Two prompting mechanisms have emerged for stylistic control: instruction based prompts that articulate abstract directives, and example based prompts that provide concrete code demonstrations. The core problem is whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial implementations with additional features while maintaining high functional accuracy. Here we show that instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts produce distinct patterns of initial control and expansion discipline over one enhancement turn. We manipulated system prompts across four conditions in a paired two-turn protocol where models first generated solutions to an intermediate Python task, then revised their code under general improvement directives, holding the user task fixed (N = 160 paired programs). Combined prompts produced the strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects and moderate expansion discipline. Examples showed modest initial effects with no expansion discipline. These results show that initial prompt effectiveness and expansion discipline are separate aspects of prompt design, and that combined approaches provide the most stable stylistic control in this two-turn workflow."}

We implement the DiLoCo algorithm as a lightweight wrapper over nanochat's training loop, performing multiple local steps per worker before synchronization with an outer optimizer, effectively reducing communication by orders of magnitude.

However, since the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) market is negligible compared to the consumer electronics market, the so-called IIoT enhancements have not yet been implemented in silicon. Moreover, there is no guarantee that this situation will change soon. Thus, alternative solutions must be explored. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a scheme that uses a protocol capable of leveraging existing infrastructure to synchronize User Equipments (UEs), with one of the UEs serving as the master. If this master is connected via a wired link to the factory network, it can also function as a boundary clock for the factory network, including any Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) network. Furthermore, the 5G Core Network (5GC) and 5G Base Station (gNB) can also be synchronized if they are connected either to the factory network or to the master UE. The proposed solution is implemented and evaluated on a hardware testbed using OpenAirInterface (OAI) and Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Time offset and clock skew are analyzed using a moving average filter with various window sizes. Results show that a filter size of 1024 provides the best accuracy for offset prediction between UEs. In a controlled lab environment, the approach consistently achieves synchronization within +/-50 ns, leaving sufficient margin for synchronization errors in real deployments while still maintaining sub-microsecond accuracy. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and high performance of the proposed protocol for stringent industrial use cases."}

While it helps students navigate programming challenges, its use also raises concerns about academic integrity and overreliance. Despite growing interest in this topic, prior research has largely relied on surveys, emphasizing trends over in-depth analysis of students' strategies and ethical awareness. This study complements existing work through a qualitative investigation of how computer science students in one UK institution strategically and ethically engage with ChatGPT in software development projects. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, it explores two key questions: How do computer science students ethically and strategically report using ChatGPT in software development projects? How do students understand and perceive the ethical issues associated with using ChatGPT in academic and professional contexts? Findings reveal a shift in students' learning models, moving from traditional \"independent thinking-manual coding-iterative debugging\" to \"AI-assisted ideation-interactive programming-collaborative optimization.\" Importantly, many use ChatGPT conversationally to deepen understanding, while consciously reserving creative and high-level decision-making tasks for themselves. Students tend to cap ChatGPT's contribution to roughly 30%, and evaluate its output to mitigate overreliance. However, only a minority thoroughly analyze AI-generated code, raising concerns about reduced critical engagement. Meanwhile, students reject uncredited use, highlight risks such as privacy breaches and skill degradation, and call for clear usage guidelines set by their teachers. This research offers novel insights into the evolving learner-AI dynamic and highlights the need for explicit guidance to support responsible and pedagogically sound use of such tools."}

However, they can hardly be employed in the same accelerator simultaneously because CIM requires structural compute patterns which are disrupted in sparse NNs. In this paper, we partially solve this issue by proposing a bit level weight reordering strategy which can realize compact mapping of sparse NN weight matrices onto Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) based NN Accelerators (RRAM-Acc). In specific, when weights are mapped to RRAM crossbars in a binary complement manner, we can observe that, which can also be mathematically proven, bit-level sparsity and similarity commonly exist in the crossbars. The bit reordering method treats bit sparsity as a special case of bit similarity, reserve only one column in a pair of columns that have identical bit values, and then map the compressed weight matrices into Operation Units (OU). The performance of our design is evaluated with typical NNs. Simulation results show a 61.24% average performance improvement and 1.51x-2.52x energy savings under different sparsity ratios, with only slight overhead compared to the state-of-the-art design."}

This hardware shift has sparked a new line of algorithm research: using low-precision units to emulate double-precision accuracy through schemes such as Ozaki decompositions. We advance this direction with Automatic Dynamic Precision (ADP), a fully GPU-resident framework that makes emulated FP64 matrix multiplication both efficient and reliable. At its core is the Exponent Span Capacity (ESC), a hardware-agnostic estimator that conservatively determines the decomposition parameter (also known as slices) required to achieve FP64-level accuracy. Built on ESC, ADP integrates exception handling, run time heuristics, and seamless fallback to native FP64, ensuring correctness without host-device synchronization or user intervention. Additionally, we further improve Ozaki-style decompositions with an unsigned integer slicing scheme, which increases representational efficiency and reduces computational waste. Validated against recently proposed BLAS grading tests, ADP consistently preserves FP64 fidelity on challenging inputs while incurring less than 10% run time overhead. In a 55-bit mantissa setting, our approach achieves up to 2.3x and 13.2x speedups over native FP64 GEMM on NVIDIA Blackwell GB200 and the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Server Edition, respectively.

This is because existing methods focus on topological structures rather than comprehensive semantic characteristics of Autonomous Systems (ASes), often misinterpreting functionally similar but topologically distant ASes.\n  To address this, we propose BGPShield, an anomaly detection framework built on LLM embeddings that captures the Behavior Portrait and Routing Policy Rationale of each AS beyond topology, such as operational scale and global role. We propose a segment-wise aggregation scheme to transform AS descriptions into LLM representations without information loss, and a lightweight contrastive reduction network to compress them into a semantic-consistent version. Using these representations, our AR-DTW algorithm aligns and accumulates semantic distances to reveal behavioral inconsistencies. Evaluated on 16 real-world datasets, BGPShield detects 100% of verified anomalies with a false discovery rate below 5%. Notably, the employed LLMs were released prior to evaluation events, verifying generalizability. Furthermore, BGPShield constructs representations for unseen ASes within one second, significantly outperforming BEAM which demands costly retraining (averaging 65 hours)."}

Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we reveal several key findings: (1) agents exhibit remarkable long-context robustness; (2) comprehension-efficiency trade-off exists with negative correlation, where thorough exploration increases comprehension but reduces efficiency; and (3) conversation efficiency varies dramatically across models, with strategic tool usage patterns differentiating high-performing agents.

Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy. For example, image classification accuracy drops by less than 4% when increasing from 2 to 8 the number of tasks multiplexed over a 4$\\times$4 channel.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically repairing flaky tests, existing approaches like FlakyDoctor fail in industrial settings due to the context problem: providing either too little context (missing critical production code) or too much context (overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant information). We present FlakyGuard, which addresses this problem by treating code as a graph structure and using selective graph exploration to find only the most relevant context. Evaluation on real-world flaky tests from industrial repositories shows that FlakyGuard repairs 47.6 % of reproducible flaky tests with 51.8 % of the fixes accepted by developers. Besides it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by at least 22 % in repair success rate. Developer surveys confirm that 100 % find FlakyGuard's root cause explanations useful."}

Emerging open GPU architectures define SIMT functionality through their own ISAs, but executing existing GPU programs and optimizing performance on these ISAs relies on a compiler framework that is technically complex and often undercounted in open hardware development costs.\n  To address this challenge, the Vortex-Optimized Lightweight Toolchain (VOLT) has been proposed. This paper presents its design principles, overall structure, and the key compiler transformations required to support SIMT execution on Vortex. VOLT enables SIMT code generation and optimization across multiple levels of abstraction through a hierarchical design that accommodates diverse front-end languages and open GPU hardware. To ensure extensibility as GPU architectures evolve, VOLT centralizes fundamental SIMT-related analyses and optimizations in the middle-end, allowing them to be reused across front-ends and easily adapted to emerging open-GPU variants. Through two case studies on ISA extensions and host-runtime API, this paper also demonstrates how VOLT can support extensions"}

A Single-Node Cross-Implementation Study on Shared-Memory Communication", "comment": "9 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "MPI's derived datatypes (DDTs) promise easier, copy-free communication of non-contiguous data, yet their practical performance remains debated and is often reported only for a single MPI stack. We present a cross-implementation assessment using three 2D applications: a Jacobi CFD solver, Conway's Game of Life, and a lattice-based image reconstruction. Each application is written in two ways: (i) a BASIC version with manual packing and unpacking of non-contiguous regions and (ii) a DDT version using MPI_Type_vector and MPI_Type_create_subarray with correct true extent via MPI_Type_create_resized. For API parity, we benchmark identical communication semantics: non-blocking point-to-point (Irecv/Isend + Waitall), neighborhood collectives (MPI_Neighbor_alltoallw), and MPI-4 persistent operations (*_init). We run strong and weak scaling on 1-4 ranks, validate bitwise-identical halos, and evaluate four widely used MPI implementations: MPICH, Open MPI, Intel MPI, and MVAPICH2 on a single ARCHER2 node. Results are mixed. DDTs can be fastest, for example for the image reconstruction code on Intel MPI and MPICH, but can also be among the slowest on other stacks, such as Open MPI and MVAPICH2 for the same code. For the CFD solver, BASIC variants generally outperform DDTs across semantics, whereas for Game of Life the ranking flips depending on the MPI library. We also observe stack-specific anomalies, for example MPICH slowdowns with DDT neighborhood and persistent modes. Overall, no strategy dominates across programs, semantics, and MPI stacks; performance portability for DDTs is not guaranteed. We therefore recommend profiling both DDT-based and manual-packing designs under the intended MPI implementation and communication mode. Our study is limited to a single node and does not analyze memory overhead; multi-node and GPU-aware paths are left for future work."}

Existing communication systems only support parallel transmissions at the bit level, which fundamentally limits the number of tasks that can be concurrently processed. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces the new concept of Semantic Multiplexing. Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy. For example, image classification accuracy drops by less than 4% when increasing from 2 to 8 the number of tasks multiplexed over a 4$\\times$4 channel. Semantic Multiplexing reduces latency, energy consumption, and communication load respectively by up to 8$\\times$, 25$\\times$, and 54$\\times$ compared to the baselines while keeping comparable performance.

A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters. We also compare Git-diff Inc-FT to full-file Inc-FT, showing that diffs excel in rename/delete-heavy windows while full-file context wins in behavior-change-heavy windows."}

Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."}

Key enhancements include a multi-disciplinary product ownership model, dual compliance-and-functionality acceptance criteria, independent testing and documentation teams, and dedicated certification liaisons. The approach was evaluated through two comparable aerospace projects-one using the customized Agile process and the other a traditional Waterfall model. Results showed significant improvements: a 76% reduction in Total Effort per Requirement, 75% faster Defect Detection, 78% faster Defect Resolution, and over 50% lower Defect Density, while maintaining full compliance with DO-178C Design Assurance Level A. These findings demonstrate that Agile practices and regulatory compliance can coexist effectively when supported by disciplined tailoring and proactive engagement with certification authorities. The study also notes challenges, including increased V&V effort due to recurring Sprint activities and refactoring inherent to iterative development.

While GPU memory offloading to CPU and NVMe has made large-scale training more feasible, existing approaches suffer from high tensor migration latency and suboptimal device memory utilization, ultimately increasing training time and cloud costs. To address these challenges, we present 10Cache, a resource-aware tensor caching and migration system that accelerates LLM training by intelligently coordinating memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe tiers. 10Cache profiles tensor execution order to construct prefetch policies, allocates memory buffers in pinned memory based on tensor size distributions, and reuses memory buffers to minimize allocation overhead.\n  Designed for cloud-scale deployments, 10Cache improves memory efficiency and reduces reliance on high-end GPUs. Across diverse LLM workloads, it achieves up to 2x speedup in training time, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases CPU/GPU memory utilization by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art offloading methods.

In this setting, achieving low end-to-end latency is governed not only by where a model is deployed (inter-tier model partitioning) but also by how incoming requests are scheduled (intra-tier task scheduling) across heterogeneous nodes. These two problems are tightly coupled, as a suboptimal scheduler can negate the benefits of a good partition, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose Hyperion, a hierarchical two-stage framework that jointly optimizes partitioning and scheduling to minimize end-to-end latency for pipelined LLM inference in multi-tier networks, balancing compute and memory across tiers while introducing negligible runtime overhead and requiring no model retraining. Motivated by the observation that partition choices evolve on slower timescales than request arrivals, Stage 1 performs offline, inter-tier partitioning via a Binary Search with Dynamic Programming (BSDP) procedure to produce balanced stage times under tier capacity and memory constraints; to adapt to time-varying load, Stage 2 performs online, intra-tier scheduling with a lightweight Adaptive Real-time Task Scheduling (ARTS) algorithm that maps each request to the best available node using real-time estimates of queue length and effective capacity. Experimental results on multi-tier inference tasks demonstrate that Hyperion significantly reduces end-to-end latency by up to 52.1\\% and 31.2\\%, with the Phi-3-medium model, compared to the GPipe and HEFT baselines, respectively. Furthermore, Hyperion shows superior scalability in long-sequence generation, maintaining a 44.5\\% lower latency than GPipe and achieving higher GPU utilization."}

This study investigates how cognitive capability and personality traits jointly relate to software problem solving among 80 participants (40 software practitioners, 40 software engineering students). Cognitive capability was measured using Baddeleys three minute grammatical reasoning test, while personality was assessed using the IPIP NEO 50 test. Participants further completed nine interview style problem solving questions. Six questions were related to coding and three were related to logical reasoning. Descriptive and correlational analyses show that practitioners achieved slightly higher grammatical reasoning accuracy and overall task performance than students. Grammatical-reasoning accuracy correlated positively with problem solving performance, indicating that stronger cognitive capability is associated with better performance in coding and logical tasks. Personality performance links were systematic. We identified that the conscientiousness trait correlated most strongly with problem solving and with reasoning accuracy, while the openness to experience trait was positively related to both outcomes. Neuroticism showed small, negative associations with accuracy and performance. Taken together, our results suggest that conscientiousness and openness to experience characteristics complement reasoning accuracy to support software problem solving, whereas elevated negative affect may hinder precision under time pressure. Our findings suggest practical implications for education and industry such as integrating structured reasoning tasks in curricula, and considering personality cognition in recruitment and role allocation.

In order to provide a reliable system, it is necessary to analyze the impact of participant failures. While this problem received attention in cross-device FL where mobile devices with limited resources participate, there is comparatively little research in cross-silo FL.\n  Therefore, we conduct an extensive study for analyzing the impact of participant failures on the model quality in the context of inter-organizational cross-silo FL with few participants.

We review the advances in interconnect technology and the APIs for multi-GPU communication. We benchmark using a variety of interconnect paths, including the recent NVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72 architecture that represents the first product to expand high-bandwidth GPU-specialized interconnects across multiple nodes. We show that while improvements to GPU architecture have led to speedups of over 4.5X across the last few generations of GPUs, advances in interconnect performance have had a larger impact with over 16X performance improvements in time to solution for multi-GPU simulations."}

A Theory on Motivations and Challenges in Software Engineering from Education to Practice", "comment": null, "summary": "Motivations and challenges jointly shape how individuals enter, persist, and evolve within software engineering (SE), yet their interplay remains underexplored across the transition from education to professional practice. We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews and employed the Gioia Methodology, an adapted grounded theory methodology from organizational behavior, to inductively derive taxonomies of motivations and challenges, and build the Exposure-Pursuit-Evaluation (EPE) Process Model. Our findings reveal that impactful early exposure triggers intrinsic motivations, while non-impactful exposure requires an extrinsic push (e.g., career/ personal goals, external validation). We identify curiosity and avoiding alternatives as a distinct educational drivers, and barriers to belonging as the only challenge persisting across education and career. Our findings show that career progression challenges (e.g., navigating the corporate world) constrain extrinsic fulfillment while technical training challenges, barriers to belonging and threats to motivation constrain intrinsic fulfillment. The theory shows how unmet motivations and recurring challenges influence persistence, career shifts, or departure from the field. Our results provide a grounded model for designing interventions that strengthen intrinsic fulfillment and reduce systemic barriers in SE education and practice."}

As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM \"agents\" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications."}
