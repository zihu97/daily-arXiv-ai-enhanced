Since too much congestion of pedestrian flows can cause serious accidents, mathematically modeling and predicting pedestrian behaviors is important for preventing such accidents and providing a safe and comfortable environment. Although numerous studies have investigated learning-based modeling methods, most of them focus only on the local behavior of pedestrians, such as collision avoidance with neighbors and environmental objects. In an actual environment, pedestrian behavior involves more complicated decision making including global route selection. Moreover, a state transition from stopping to walking at a traffic light should be considered simultaneously. In this study, the proposed model integrates local behaviors with global route selection, using an Attention mechanism to ensure consistent global and local behavior predictions. We recorded video data of pedestrians at Shibuya scramble crossing and trained the proposed model using pedestrian walking trajectory data obtained from the video. Simulations of pedestrian behaviors based on the trained model qualitatively and quantitatively validated that the proposed model can appropriately predict pedestrian behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u907f\u969c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6da9\u8c37\u5341\u5b57\u8def\u53e3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u9632\u6b62\u56e0\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62e5\u6324\u5f15\u53d1\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8425\u9020\u5b89\u5168\u8212\u9002\u7684\u6b65\u884c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u907f\u969c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6da9\u8c37\u5341\u5b57\u8def\u53e3\u89c6\u9891\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Current HBM stacks include short on-die ECC that tightens binning, raises price, and fixes reliability policy inside the device. This paper asks whether a system can tolerate a much higher raw HBM bit error rate and still keep end-to-end correctness and throughput, without changing the HBM PHY or the fixed 32 B transaction size. We propose REACH, a controller managed ECC design that keeps the HBM link and 32 B transfers unchanged. REACH uses a two level Reed-Solomon scheme: each 32 B chunk uses an inner code to check and correct most faults locally, while chunks that cannot be fixed are marked as erasures. An outer code spans kilobytes and runs in erasure only mode, repairing only flagged chunks and avoiding the expensive locator step. For small random writes, REACH updates outer parity with differential parity to avoid recomputing parity over the whole span, and an optional importance adaptive bit plane policy can protect only critical fields such as BF16 exponents to reduce ECC work and traffic. On three LLMs at 8K context, REACH keeps about 79 percent of on-die ECC throughput at zero BER and remains qualified up to a raw BER of 1e-3, extending tolerable device error rates by about three orders of magnitude while keeping tokens per second nearly flat. In ASAP7, a full REACH controller occupies 15.2 mm2 and consumes 17.5 W at 3.56 TB/s, and it reduces ECC area by 11.6x and power by about 60 percent compared to a naive long Reed-Solomon baseline. By moving strong ECC into the controller, REACH turns long code reliability into a system choice that can enable lower cost HBM under the same standard interface.", "AI": {"tldr": "REACH\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7ba1\u7406\u7684ECC\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5c42Reed-Solomon\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u4fdd\u6301HBM\u63a5\u53e3\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u5bb9\u5fcd\u539f\u59cb\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dHBM\u56e0\u77ed\u8ddd\u7247\u4e0aECC\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u56fa\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u539f\u59cb\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u5c42Reed-Solomon\u7f16\u7801\uff1a\u5185\u5c42\u5c40\u90e8\u7ea0\u9519\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u4ec5\u4fee\u590d\u6807\u8bb0\u5757\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u5dee\u5206\u5947\u5076\u6821\u9a8c\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f4d\u5e73\u9762\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u57288K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cREACH\u5728\u539f\u59cbBER\u8fbe1e-3\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd179%\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u9762\u79ef\u51cf\u5c1111.6\u500d\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea660%\u3002", "conclusion": "REACH\u5c06\u5f3aECC\u79fb\u81f3\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u957f\u7801\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u63a5\u53e3\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u6210\u672cHBM\u3002"}}

We present the first LLM serving engine that supports cross-model prefix cache reuse between base and adapted models via Activated LoRA (aLoRA), enabling efficient and fine-grained adapter switching during inference. Our design extends the vLLM framework by introducing base-aligned block hashing and activation-aware masking within the model execution path, permitting cache reuse across models while preserving compatibility with existing serving engine optimizations. Integrated into a production-grade inference stack, this approach supports dynamic adapter activation without excessive key-value tensor recomputation. Evaluation across representative multi-turn, multi-adapter pipelines demonstrates up to 58x end-to-end latency reduction and over 100x time-to-first-token improvement relative to standard LoRA baselines, with benefits that scale with model size and sequence length and manifest across all stages of the request lifecycle.

As these systems scale, they become increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where malicious agents interfere with legitimate transmissions to reduce data rates, thereby inflating the age of information (AoI). Existing adversarial AoI models often assume stationary channels and overlook queueing dynamics arising from compromised sensing sources operating under resource constraints. Motivated by the G-queue framework, this paper investigates a two-source M/G/1/1 system in which one source is adversarial and disrupts the update process by injecting negative arrivals according to a Poisson process and inducing i.i.d. service slowdowns, bounded in attack rate and duration.

To enable fine-grained parallelism, we propose a massively parallel array of specialized bit-serial bank PE and channel PE designed to accelerate the core min-plus operations. Our novel dataflow complements this hardware, employing an interleaved mapping policy for superior load balancing and hybrid in and near memory computing model for efficient computation and reduction. The novel in-bank computing approach allows all distance updates to be performed and stored in memory bank, a key contribution is that eliminates the data movement bottleneck inherent in GPU-based approaches.

To efficiently perform DRAM writes, modern systems buffer write requests and try to complete multiple write operations whenever the DRAM mode is switched from read to write. When the DRAM system is performing writes, it is not available to service read requests, thus increasing read latency and reducing performance. We observe that, given the presence of on-die ECC in DDR5 devices, the time to perform a write operation varies significantly: from 1x (for writes to banks of different bankgroups) to 6x (for writes to banks within the same bankgroup) to 24x (for conflicting requests to the same bank). If we can orchestrate the write stream to favor write requests that incur lower latency, then we can reduce the stall time from DRAM writes and improve performance. However, for current systems, the write stream is dictated by the cache replacement policy, which makes eviction decisions without being aware of the variable latency of DRAM writes. The key insight of our work is to improve performance by modifying the cache replacement policy to increase bank-parallelism of DRAM writes.\n  Our paper proposes {\\em BARD (Bank-Aware Replacement Decisions)}, which modifies the cache replacement policy to favor dirty lines that belong to banks without pending writes. We analyze two variants of BARD: BARD-E (Eviction-based), which changes the eviction policy to evict low-cost dirty lines, and BARD-C (Cleansing-Based), which proactively cleans low-cost dirty lines without modifying the eviction decisions. We develop a hybrid policy (BARD-H), which uses a selective combination of both eviction and writeback. Our evaluations across workloads from SPEC2017, LIGRA, STREAM, and Google server traces show that BARD-H improves performance by 4.3\\% on average and up-to 8.5\\%.

While classical software engineering has developed a rich body of dynamic and static techniques to study flakiness, corresponding evidence for quantum software remains limited. Prior work relies primarily on static analysis or small sets of manually reported incidents, leaving open questions about the prevalence, characteristics, and detectability of flaky tests.\n  This paper presents the first large-scale dynamic characterization of flaky tests in quantum software. We executed the Qiskit Terra test suite 10,000 times across 23 releases in controlled environments. For each release, we measured test-outcome variability, identified flaky tests, estimated empirical failure probabilities, analyzed recurrence across versions, and used Wilson confidence intervals to quantify rerun budgets for reliable detection. We further mapped flaky tests to Terra subcomponents to assess component-level susceptibility.\n  Across 27,026 test cases, we identified 290 distinct flaky tests. Although overall flakiness rates were low (0-0.4%), flakiness was highly episodic: nearly two-thirds of flaky tests appeared in only one release, while a small subset recurred intermittently or persistently. Many flaky tests failed with very small empirical probabilities ($\\hat{p} \\approx 10^{-4}$), implying that tens of thousands of executions may be required for confident detection. Flakiness was unevenly distributed across subcomponents, with 'transpiler' and 'quantum_info' accounting for the largest share.\n  These results show that quantum test flakiness is rare but difficult to detect under typical continuous integration budgets.

However, the reliability of CiM-based systems is challenged by stuck-at faults (SAFs) in memory cells, which corrupt stored weights and lead to accuracy degradation. While closest value mapping (CVM) has been shown to partially mitigate these effects for multibit DNNs deployed on bit-sliced crossbars, its fault tolerance is often insufficient under high SAF rates or for complex tasks. In this work, we propose two training-free weight transformation techniques, sign-flip and bit-flip, that enhance SAF tolerance in multi-bit DNNs deployed on bit-sliced crossbar arrays. Sign-flip operates at the weight-column level by selecting between a weight and its negation, whereas bit-flip provides finer granularity by selectively inverting individual bit slices. Both methods expand the search space for fault-aware mappings, operate synergistically with CVM, and require no retraining or additional memory. To enable scalability, we introduce a look-up-table (LUT)-based framework that accelerates the computation of optimal transformations and supports rapid evaluation across models and fault rates. Extensive experiments on ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ViT models with CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed techniques recover most of the accuracy lost under SAF injection. Hardware analysis shows that these methods incur negligible overhead, with sign-flip leading to negligible energy, latency, and area cost, and bit-flip providing higher fault resilience with modest overheads. These results establish sign-flip and bit-flip as practical and scalable SAF-mitigation strategies for CiM-based DNN accelerators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684sign-flip\u548cbit-flip\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347CiM\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e0a\u591a\u6bd4\u7279DNN\u5bf9SAF\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u4e14\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3CiM\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u56e0\u5b58\u50a8\u5355\u5143\u5361\u6b7b\u6545\u969c\u5bfc\u81f4DNN\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709CVM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u6545\u969c\u7387\u6216\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u53d8\u6362\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u5217\u7ea7\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff08sign-flip\uff09\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7247\u7ea7\u6bd4\u7279\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff08bit-flip\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728ResNet\u4e0eViT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6062\u590dCIFAR-100\u4e0eImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u786c\u4ef6\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\uff0cbit-flip\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u5bb9\u9519\u6027\u4f34\u968f\u9002\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "sign-flip\u4e0ebit-flip\u662f\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684SAF\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6bd4\u7279DNN\u5728CiM\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

In this framework, pinching-antenna systems (PASs) have recently been proposed as a promising enabling technology, as they allow the radiation location and effective propagation distance to be adjusted by selectively exciting radiating points along a dielectric waveguide. However, most existing studies on PASs rely on the idealized assumption that pinching-antenna (PA) positions can be continuously adjusted along the waveguide, while realistically only a finite set of pinching locations is available. Motivated by this, this paper analyzes the performance of two-state PASs, where the PA positions are fixed and only their activation state can be controlled. By explicitly accounting for the spatial discreteness of the available pinching points, closed-form analytical expressions for the outage probability and the ergodic achievable data rate are derived. In addition, we introduce the pinching discretization efficiency to quantify the performance gap between discrete and continuous pinching configurations, enabling a direct assessment of the number of PAs required to approximate the ideal continuous case. Finally, numerical results validate the analytical framework and show that near-continuous performance can be achieved with a limited number of PAs, offering useful insights for the design and deployment of PASs in PWEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u65e0\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u53cc\u6001\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e2d\u65ad\u6982\u7387\u548c\u904d\u5386\u53ef\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u7387\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u5939\u6301\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u79bb\u6563\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ef\u8fde\u7eed\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\u79bb\u6563\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e2d\u65ad\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u904d\u5386\u6570\u636e\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5939\u6301\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u5373\u53ef\u903c\u8fd1\u8fde\u7eed\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u65e0\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Existing methods often prioritize global metrics, overlooking per-client QoS, which is crucial for latency-sensitive and reliability-critical applications. We propose QEdgeProxy, a decentralized QoS-aware load balancer that acts as a proxy between IoT devices and service instances in CC. We formulate the load balancing problem as a Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandit (MP-MAB) with heterogeneous rewards, where each load balancer autonomously selects service instances that maximize the probability of meeting its clients' QoS targets by using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate QoS success probabilities. It also incorporates an adaptive exploration mechanism to recover rapidly from performance shifts and non-stationary conditions. We present a Kubernetes-native QEdgeProxy implementation and evaluate it on an emulated CC testbed deployed on a K3s cluster with realistic network conditions and a latency-sensitive edge-AI workload.

However, quality of the raw sensing data may degrade in occluded or distant regions, undermining the fidelity of constructed BEV map. In this paper, we propose BEVCooper, a novel collaborative perception framework that can guarantee accurate and low-latency BEV map construction. We first define an effective metric to evaluate the utility of BEV features from neighboring CAVs. Then, based on this, we develop an online learning-based collaborative CAV selection strategy that captures the ever-changing BEV feature utility of neighboring vehicles, enabling the ego CAV to prioritize the most valuable sources under bandwidth-constrained vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. Furthermore, we design an adaptive fusion mechanism that optimizes BEV feature compression based on the environment dynamics and real-time V2V channel quality, effectively balancing feature transmission latency and accuracy of the constructed BEV map. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, BEVCooper achieves asymptotically optimal CAV selection and adaptive feature fusion under dynamic vehicular topology and V2V channel conditions. Extensive experiments on real-world testbed show that, compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, the proposed BEVCooper enhances BEV perception accuracy by up to $63.18\\%$ and reduces end-to-end latency by $67.9\\%$, with only $1.8\\%$ additional computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "BEVCooper\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8054\u7f51\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\uff08BEV\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u539f\u59cb\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u5728\u906e\u6321\u6216\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u533a\u57df\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdBEV\u5730\u56fe\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u534f\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBEV\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u8f66\u8f86\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u5730\u56fe\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cBEVCooper\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad863.18%\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf67.9%\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a01.8%\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "BEVCooper\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Prior GPU solutions assign different thread blocks to different sub-trees, while using a shared worklist to balance the load. However, these prior solutions do not scale to large and complex graphs because their unawareness of when the graph splits into components causes them to solve these components redundantly. Moreover, their high memory footprint limits the number of workers that can execute concurrently. We propose a novel GPU solution for vertex cover problems that detects when a graph splits into components and branches on the components independently. Although the need to aggregate the solutions of different components introduces non-tail-recursive branches which interfere with load balancing, we overcome this challenge by delegating the post-processing to the last descendant of each branch.

Meanwhile, serverless computing, with its elasticity and pay-per-use billing, is well-suited for deploying MoEs with bursty workloads. However, the large number of experts in MoE models incurs high inference costs due to memory-intensive parameter caching. These costs are difficult to mitigate via simple model partitioning due to input-dependent expert activation. To address these issues, we propose Remoe, a heterogeneous MoE inference system tailored for serverless computing. Remoe assigns non-expert modules to GPUs and expert modules to CPUs, and further offloads infrequently activated experts to separate serverless functions to reduce memory overhead and enable parallel execution. We incorporate three key techniques: (1) a Similar Prompts Searching (SPS) algorithm to predict expert activation patterns based on semantic similarity of inputs; (2) a Main Model Pre-allocation (MMP) algorithm to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs) via worst-case memory estimation; and (3) a joint memory and replica optimization framework leveraging Lagrangian duality and the Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm. We implement Remoe on Kubernetes and evaluate it across multiple LLM benchmarks.

In this paper, we present Self-play SWE-RL (SSR), a first step toward training paradigms for superintelligent software agents. Our approach takes minimal data assumptions, only requiring access to sandboxed repositories with source code and installed dependencies, with no need for human-labeled issues or tests. Grounded in these real-world codebases, a single LLM agent is trained via reinforcement learning in a self-play setting to iteratively inject and repair software bugs of increasing complexity, with each bug formally specified by a test patch rather than a natural language issue description. On the SWE-bench Verified and SWE-Bench Pro benchmarks, SSR achieves notable self-improvement (+10.4 and +7.8 points, respectively) and consistently outperforms the human-data baseline over the entire training trajectory, despite being evaluated on natural language issues absent from self-play.

Existing approaches either enforce a single global model that fits no one well, or rely on heuristic peer selection mechanisms that cannot distinguish between peers with genuinely incompatible data distributions and those with valuable complementary knowledge. We present Murmura, a framework that leverages evidential deep learning to enable trust-aware model personalization in DFL. Our key insight is that epistemic uncertainty from Dirichlet-based evidential models directly indicates peer compatibility: high epistemic uncertainty when a peer's model evaluates local data reveals distributional mismatch, enabling nodes to exclude incompatible influence while maintaining personalized models through selective collaboration. Murmura introduces a trust-aware aggregation mechanism that computes peer compatibility scores through cross-evaluation on local validation samples and personalizes model aggregation based on evidential trust with adaptive thresholds. Evaluation on three wearable IoT datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, PPG-DaLiA) demonstrates that Murmura reduces performance degradation from IID to non-IID conditions compared to baseline (0.9% vs. 19.3%), achieves 7.4$\\times$ faster convergence, and maintains stable accuracy across hyperparameter choices.

These issues weaken the supervision signal available to learning-based models and complicate evaluation.\n  We introduce \\textbf{Code2Doc}, a quality-first curated dataset for function-level code documentation generation. Code2Doc consists of 13,358 high-quality function-documentation pairs extracted from widely used open-source repositories spanning five programming languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and C++. The dataset is constructed using a four-stage curation pipeline that enforces documentation completeness and clarity, filters functions based on structural and complexity criteria, removes exact and near-duplicate code, and identifies documentation likely to be AI generated. Starting from 52,069 extracted candidates, only 25.6 percent satisfy all quality constraints.\n  We provide a detailed analysis of the resulting dataset, which achieves a mean documentation quality score of 6.93 out of 10. Overall, 86.9% of samples contain explicit type annotations, and only 2.9\\% are flagged as potentially AI generated. Baseline experiments show that fine-tuning a large language model on Code2Doc yields relative improvements of 29.47% in BLEU and 24.04% in ROUGE-L over zero shot performance, despite the modest dataset size.

We present L4, a runtime system that dynamically reschedules requests across multiple instances serving the same LLM to mitigate per-instance length heterogeneity. L4 partitions these instances into length-specialized groups, each handling requests within a designated length range, naturally forming a pipeline as requests flow through them. L4 devises a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently find the stage partition with the best QoE, employs runtime range refinement together with decentralized load (re)balance both across and within groups, achieving a balanced and efficient multi-instance service. Our evaluation shows that, under the same configuration, L4 reduces end-to-end latency by up to 67% and tail latency by up to 69%, while improving overall system throughput by up to 2.89 times compared to the state-of-the-art multi-instance scheduling systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "L4\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u7ec4\u4f18\u5316GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5ffd\u7565\u6279\u5185\u8bf7\u6c42\u957f\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "L4\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6309\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316QoE\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8303\u56f4\u7ec6\u5316\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0cL4\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e67%\uff0c\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e69%\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53472.89\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "L4\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8bf7\u6c42\u957f\u5ea6\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u670d\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

An Empirical Study of Scientific Workflow Systems on GitHub", "comment": "7", "summary": "Scientific Workflow Systems (SWSs) play a vital role in enabling reproducible, scalable, and automated scientific analysis. Like other open-source software, these systems depend on active maintenance and community engagement to remain reliable and sustainable. However, despite the importance of timely issue resolution for software quality and community trust, little is known about what drives issue resolution speed within SWSs. This paper presents an empirical study of issue management and resolution across a collection of GitHub-hosted SWS projects. We analyze 21,116 issues to investigate how project characteristics, issue metadata, and contributor interactions affect time-to-close. Specifically, we address two research questions: (1) how issues are managed and addressed in SWSs, and (2) how issue and contributor features relate to issue resolution speed. We find that 68.91% of issues are closed, with half of them resolved within 18.09 days.

In the last decade, deep learning recommender models (DLRMs) are the de-facto standard in this field. The main bottleneck in DLRM inference is the lookup of sparse features across huge embedding tables, which are usually partitioned across the aggregate RAM of many nodes. In state-of-the-art recommender systems, the distributed lookup is implemented via irregular all-to-all (alltoallv) communication, and often presents the main bottleneck. Today, most related work sees this operation as a given; in addition, every collective is synchronous in nature. In this work, we propose a novel bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation. The bound can be a parameter allowing slower processes to lag behind entire iterations before the fastest processes block. In special applications such as inference-only DLRM, the accuracy of the application is fully preserved. We implement BLS alltoallv in a new PyTorch Distributed backend and evaluate it with a BLS version of the reference DLRM code. We show that for well balanced, homogeneous-access DLRM runs our BLS technique does not offer notable advantages. But for unbalanced runs, e.g. runs with strongly irregular embedding table accesses or with delays across different processes, our BLS technique improves both the latency and throughput of inference-only DLRM. In the best-case scenario, the proposed reduced synchronisation can mask the delays across processes altogether.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u754c\u6ede\u540e\u540c\u6b65alltoallv\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fDLRM\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u56e0\u540c\u6b65\u901a\u4fe1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u754c\u6ede\u540e\u540c\u6b65\uff08BLS\uff09\u7248alltoallv\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230PyTorch\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u540e\u7aef\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53c2\u8003DLRM\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u6216\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cBLS\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b8c\u5168\u63a9\u76d6\u8fdb\u7a0b\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "BLS\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316DLRM\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

PEAK utilizes the key insight that iterative code transformations (optimizations) can straightforwardly be written in natural language, and then carried out by LLMs. Thus, these transformations can be rapidly developed, encoding general portable optimizations, but also easily specialized to specific GPU devices and even kernels. These natural transformations are supported by a modular and extensible infrastructure that additionally performs validation and performance evaluation. We demonstrate the flexibility of PEAK by instantiating it for three backends, CUDA, HIP, and HLSL, and create 16 natural transformations for optimizing matrix multiplication kernels. We show that our resulting implementations are competitive with vendor libraries when available, and for HLSL (without a library) our implementations match the hardware documented FLOPS. PEAK allows the fine-grained exploration of several research questions around how LLMs behave in this domain, including characterizing transformations and their errors; and how performance evolves along optimization sequences.

On the BLP-2025 Bangla Code Generation benchmark, BanglaForge achieves a competitive Pass@1 accuracy of 84.00%, demonstrating the effectiveness of retrieval, model collaboration, and self-refinement for low-resource Bangla code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "BanglaForge\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0e\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728BLP-2025\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523084%\u7684Pass@1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u662f\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u4ee3\u7801\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3001LLM\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728BLP-2025\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBanglaForge\u5b9e\u73b084.00%\u7684Pass@1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0e\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

We innovate by connecting the labour performed inside digital platforms to the professional employment of participants. Our case study analyses 8,924 R package repositories on GitHub, examining commits and communications. Our quantitative findings show that researchers, alongside non-affiliated contributors, are the most frequent owners of R package repositories and their most active contributors. Researchers are more likely to hold official roles compared to the average, and to engage in collaborative problem-solving and support work during package development. This means there is, underneath the 'recognised' category of star researchers who transition between academia and industry and secure generous funding, an 'unrecognised' category of researchers who not only create and maintain key statistical infrastructure, but also provide support to industry employees, for no remuneration. Our qualitative findings show how this unrecognised labour affects practitioners.

However, their susceptibility to backdoor attacks presents a significant security risk. The state-of-the-art understanding focuses on injection-based attacks, which insert anomalous patterns into software code. These attacks can be neutralized by standard sanitization techniques. This status quo may lead to a false sense of security regarding backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new kind of backdoor attacks, dubbed Semantically-Equivalent Transformation (SET)-based backdoor attacks, which use semantics-preserving low-prevalence code transformations to generate stealthy triggers. We propose a framework to guide the generation of such triggers. Our experiments across five tasks, six languages, and models like CodeBERT, CodeT5, and StarCoder show that SET-based attacks achieve high success rates (often >90%) while preserving model utility. The attack proves highly stealthy, evading state-of-the-art defenses with detection rates on average over 25.13% lower than injection-based counterparts. We evaluate normalization-based countermeasures and find they offer only partial mitigation, confirming the attack's robustness. These results motivate further investigation into scalable defenses tailored to SET-based attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5SET\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u6362\u751f\u6210\u9690\u853d\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6ce8\u5165\u5f0f\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6613\u88ab\u5e38\u89c4\u6e05\u7406\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u548c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSET\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u6362\u751f\u6210\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728CodeBERT\u3001CodeT5\u3001StarCoder\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "SET\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e38\u8d8590%\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e0d\u53d7\u635f\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u6ce8\u5165\u5f0f\u653b\u51fb\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e25.13%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u9632\u5fa1\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "SET\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9690\u853d\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

We propose an embedding-based framework to uncover the latent families of PLs. Our approach begins by defining 21 primary linguistic features of programming languages, such as variable definition, control structures, and method declarations, and then employs LLMs to generate feature-aligned code samples across multiple languages. By embedding these semantically parallel code snippets from 19 languages, we construct a similarity matrix and perform hierarchical clustering to uncover inherent language relationships. Our analysis reveals clear hierarchical structures among programming languages. Closely related languages form well-defined clusters (e.g., C, C++, Java, and Swift group together), while Go exhibits as a central language with the highest cross-language similarity. Building on the uncovered language families, we propose three strategies to enhance multilingual LLM training: transfer learning across linguistically related languages, linguistic proximity-guided curriculum learning, and centroid-based intermediary code translation. Experiments on 4 code intelligence tasks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve multilingual LLM performance.

Adoption is highest among students and less experienced programmers, with variation across fields. Scientific programmers overwhelmingly prefer general-purpose conversational interfaces like ChatGPT over developer-specific tools. Both inexperience and limited use of development practices (like testing, code review, and version control) are associated with greater perceived productivity-but these factors interact, suggesting formal practices may partially compensate for inexperience. The strongest predictor of perceived productivity is the number of lines of generated code typically accepted at once. These findings suggest scientific programmers using generative AI may gauge productivity by code generation rather than validation, raising concerns about research code integrity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86868\u540d\u79d1\u7814\u7f16\u7a0b\u4eba\u5458\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8f83\u5c11\u8005\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4f30\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u79d1\u7814\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u7814\u4eba\u5458\u666e\u904d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u867d\u53ef\u8f85\u52a9\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u5377\u8c03\u67e5868\u540d\u79d1\u7814\u7f16\u7a0b\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u597d\u3001\u91c7\u7eb3\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8f83\u5c11\u8005\u91c7\u7eb3\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff1b\u504f\u597d\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5de5\u5177\u5982ChatGPT\uff1b\u63a5\u53d7\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u6570\u8d8a\u591a\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u8df5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u8005\u66f4\u6613\u9ad8\u4f30\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79d1\u7814\u4eba\u5458\u53ef\u80fd\u4ee5\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8d28\u91cf\u8861\u91cf\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u79d1\u7814\u4ee3\u7801\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u52a0\u5f3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u8df5\u57f9\u8bad\u3002"}}
