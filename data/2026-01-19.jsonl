This paper presents SwiftKV Attention, a per-token pipelined, low-latency single-pass attention inference algorithm, where every (kt, vt) in the KV cache is processed exactly once in a uniform per-token pipeline without score materialization, blockwise softmax, or a second pass, thereby enabling fast execution on edge accelerators with a single hardware set and no resource-intensive parallelism. Furthermore, to address the limited support for multi-head LLM decoding in existing accelerators, we design the SwiftKV-MHA accelerator, which enables high precision attention and low precision GEMV on the same processor array, achieving fast and efficient multi-head parallel decoding. Experimental results show that, on the edge accelerator, the SwiftKV Attention algorithm achieves a 7.16* speedup over native attention and significantly outperforms other attention algorithms. SwiftKV-MHA further reduces attention latency by 13.48*; under the same settings, it improves generation speed by 17.4% and increases token efficiency by 1.98* compared with state-of-the-art works."}

However, GRW workloads are notoriously difficult to accelerate due to their strong data dependencies, irregular memory access patterns, and imbalanced execution behavior. While recent work explores FPGA-based accelerators for GRWs, existing solutions fall far short of hardware potential due to inefficient pipelining and static scheduling. This paper presents RidgeWalker, a high-performance GRW accelerator designed for datacenter FPGAs. The key insight behind RidgeWalker is that the Markov property of GRWs allows decomposition into stateless, fine-grained tasks that can be executed out-of-order without compromising correctness. Building on this, RidgeWalker introduces an asynchronous pipeline architecture with a feedback-driven scheduler grounded in queuing theory, enabling perfect pipelining and adaptive load balancing. We prototype RidgeWalker on datacenter FPGAs and evaluated it across a range of GRW algorithms and real-world graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RidgeWalker achieves an average speedup of 7.0x over state-of-the-art FPGA solutions and 8.1x over GPU solutions, with peak speedups of up to 71.0x and 22.9x, respectively.

Digital Compute-in-Memory (DCiM) using SRAM offers a scalable solution, but its vast design space makes manual design impractical, creating a need for automated compilers. A key opportunity lies in approximate computing, which leverages the error tolerance of AI applications for significant energy savings. However, existing DCiM compilers focus on exact arithmetic, failing to exploit this optimization. This paper introduces OpenACM, the first open-source, accuracy-aware compiler for SRAM-based approximate DCiM architectures. OpenACM bridges the gap between application error tolerance and hardware automation. Its key contribution is an integrated library of accuracy-configurable multipliers (exact, tunable approximate, and logarithmic), enabling designers to make fine-grained accuracy-energy trade-offs. The compiler automates the generation of the DCiM architecture, integrating a transistor-level customizable SRAM macro with variation-aware characterization into a complete, open-source physical design flow based on OpenROAD and the FreePDK45 library. This ensures full reproducibility and accessibility, removing dependencies on proprietary tools. Experimental results on representative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate that OpenACM achieves energy savings of up to 64\\% with negligible loss in application accuracy.

While prior work has extensively studied the performance of the basic scheme, there has been less published work on adapting this technique to many aspects of large-scale systems. Based on our experience in building and running planet-scale cloud applications, we extend the understanding of d-way balanced allocation along the following dimensions:\n  (i) Bursts: Events such as breaking news can produce bursts of requests that may temporarily exceed the servicing capacity of the system. Thus, we explore what happens during a burst and how long it takes for the system to recover from such bursts. (ii) Priorities: Production systems need to handle jobs with a mix of priorities (e.g., user facing requests may be high priority while other requests may be low priority). We extend d-way balanced allocation to handle multiple priorities. (iii) Noise: Production systems are often typically distributed and thus d-way balanced allocation must work with stale or incorrect information. Thus we explore the impact of noisy information and their interactions with bursts and priorities.\n  We explore the above using both extensive simulations and analytical arguments. Specifically we show, (i) using simulations, that d-way balanced allocation quickly recovers from bursts and can gracefully handle priorities and noise; and (ii) that analysis of the underlying generative models complements our simulations and provides insight into our simulation results."}

We focus on an important yet underestimated aspect of the system, where action synchronization across all UAVs is impossible. Since most existing learning-based solutions are not designed to learn in this asynchronous environment, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process and introduce an asynchronous multi-agent learning algorithm to learn UAVs' cooperative policies. Once the UAVs' trajectory policies are learned, the bandwidth allocation can be optimally solved based on local observations at each collection point. Comprehensive empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other learning-based and heuristic baselines in terms of both energy efficiency and mission completion time. Additionally, the learned policies exhibit robustness under varying environmental conditions."}

Developers often need to reason not only about the structure of the code, but also about its domain logic and runtime behaviors, which are typically implicit and scattered. We introduce LogicLens, a reactive conversational agent that assists developers in exploring complex software systems through a semantic multi-repository graph. This graph is built in a preprocessing step by combining syntactic code analysis, via AST parsing and repository traversal, with semantic enrichment using Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting graph captures both structural elements, such as files, classes, and functions, as well as functional abstractions like domain entities, operations, and workflows. Once the graph is constructed, LogicLens enables developers to interact with it via natural language, dynamically retrieving relevant subgraphs and answering technical or functional queries. We present the architecture of the system, discuss emergent behaviors, and evaluate its effectiveness on real-world multi-repository scenarios. We demonstrate emergent capabilities including impact analysis and symptom-based debugging that arise naturally from the semantic graph structure."}

Even in small-scale applications, the number of possible fusion configurations is vast, making brute-force benchmarking in production both cost- and time-prohibitive.\n  In this paper, we present a system that can analyze every possible fusion setup of complex applications. By emulating the FaaS platform, our system enables local experimentation, eliminating the need to reconfigure the live platform and significantly reducing associated cost and time. We evaluate all fusion configurations across a number of example FaaS applications and resource limits. Our results reveal that, when analyzing cost and latency trade-offs, only a limited set of fusion configurations represent optimal solutions, which are strongly influenced by the specific pricing model in use."}

Method: We conduct a multi-artifact analysis across code comments, commit messages, pull requests, and issue trackers from 23 open-source SSW projects. We construct and validate a curated dataset of scientific debt, develop a multi-source SATD classifier, and conduct a practitioner validation to assess the practical relevance of scientific debt. Results: Our classifier performs strongly across 900,358 artifacts from 23 SSW projects. SATD is most prevalent in pull requests and issue trackers, underscoring the value of multi-artifact analysis. Models trained on traditional SATD often miss scientific debt, emphasizing the need for its explicit detection in SSW. Practitioner validation confirmed that scientific debt is both recognizable and useful in practice. Conclusions: Scientific debt represents a unique form of SATD in SSW that that is not adequately captured by traditional categories and requires specialized identification and management. Our dataset, classification analysis, and practitioner validation results provide the first formal multi-artifact perspective on scientific debt, highlighting the need for tailored SATD detection approaches in SSW."}

Most approaches tag messages with causality information and buffer them at the receiver until they can be safely delivered. Except for specific approaches that exploit communication topology, therefore not generally applicable, they incur a metadata overhead which is prohibitive for a large number of processes. Much less used are the approaches that enforce causal order by buffering messages at the sender, until it is safe to release them to the network, as the classic algorithm has too many drawbacks. In this paper, first we discuss the limitations of sender-only buffering approaches and introduce the Sender Permission to Send (SPS) enforcement strategy, showing that SPS + FIFO implies Causal. We analyze a recent sender-buffering algorithm, Cykas, which follows SPS + FIFO, albeit very conservatively, pointing out throughput scalability and liveness issues. Then, we introduce a novel SPS + FIFO based algorithm, which adopts a new hybrid approach: enforcing causality by combining sender-buffering to enforce SPS and receiver-buffering to enforce FIFO. The algorithm overcomes limitations of sender-only buffering, and achieves effectively constant metadata size per message. By a careful choice of data-structures, the algorithm is also computationally-optimal, with amortized effectively constant processing overhead. As far as we know, there is no other topology-agnostic causal delivery algorithm with these properties."}

Testing PRs is critical to maintaining software quality. Yet, even in projects with extensive test suites, some PR-modified lines remain untested, leaving a \"last-mile\" regression test gap. Existing test generators typically aim to improve overall coverage, but do not specifically target the uncovered lines in PRs. We present Change And Cover (ChaCo), an LLM-based test augmentation technique that addresses this gap. It makes three contributions: (i) ChaCo considers the PR-specific patch coverage, offering developers augmented tests for code just when it is on the developers' mind. (ii) We identify providing suitable test context as a crucial challenge for an LLM to generate useful tests, and present two techniques to extract relevant test content, such as existing test functions, fixtures, and data generators. (iii) To make augmented tests acceptable for developers, ChaCo carefully integrates them into the existing test suite, e.g., by matching the test's structure and style with the existing tests, and generates a summary of the test addition for developer review. We evaluate ChaCo on 145 PRs from three popular and complex open-source projects - SciPy, Qiskit, and Pandas. The approach successfully helps 30% of PRs achieve full patch coverage, at the cost of $0.11, showing its effectiveness and practicality. Human reviewers find the tests to be worth adding (4.53/5.0), well integrated (4.2/5.0), and relevant to the PR (4.7/5.0). Ablations show test context is crucial for context-aware test generation, leading to 2x coverage. We submitted 12 tests, of which 8 have already been merged, and two previously unknown bugs were exposed and fixed. We envision our approach to be integrated into CI workflows, automating the last mile of regression test augmentation."}

Specifically, we investigate the tasks that practitioners tend to automate using GitHub Actions, their preferred workflow creation mechanisms, and the non-functional characteristics they prioritise. We also examine the practices and challenges associated with GitHub's workflow reuse mechanisms. We observe a tendency to focus automation efforts on core CI/CD tasks, with less emphasis on crucial areas like security analysis and performance monitoring. Practitioners strongly rely on reusable Actions, but reusable workflows see less frequent adoption. Furthermore, we observed challenges with Action versioning and maintenance. Copy-pasting remains a common practice to have more control and avoid the complexity of depending on reusable components. These insights suggest the need for improved tooling, enhanced support for a wide range of automation tasks, and better mechanisms for discovering, managing, and trusting reusable workflow components."}

The white paper is based on the results of my dissertation, which aimed to translate scientific findings into practical guidance. To this end, I collaborated with other researchers to support three teams from different companies in adapting and establishing a technical debt management system tailored to their specific needs. Research findings were supplemented with details or additional approaches. Research results that were less practical were discarded. The result is a guide on establishing technical debt management within a team. The guide is intended to provide orientation and not be a rigid framework. We distinguish between \"best practices\" and \"nice-to-haves.\" \"Best practices\" are understood to be all approaches that were adopted by all three teams. \"Nice-to-haves\" were used by at least one team. In many places, it is explicitly mentioned that the team should decide together how to design the process. This also applies, of course, to all areas where this was not explicitly mentioned. This white paper explicitly does not cover the establishment of technical debt management across the entire company, but provides suggestions for this at the end."}
