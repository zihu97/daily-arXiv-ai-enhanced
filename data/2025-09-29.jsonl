This paper introduces Green\nPrompt Engineering, framing linguistic complexity as a design dimension that\ncan influence energy consumption and performance. We conduct an empirical study\non requirement classification using open-source Small Language Models, varying\nthe readability of prompts. Our results reveal that readability affects\nenvironmental sustainability and performance, exposing trade-offs between them.\nFor practitioners, simpler prompts can reduce energy costs without a\nsignificant F1-score loss; for researchers, it opens a path toward guidelines\nand studies on sustainable prompt design within the Green AI agenda."}

To\nsupport the diverse update strategies required by users, we propose a unified\nrepresentation for specifying arbitrary user-defined update strategies, along\nwith a dependency analysis algorithm. Furthermore, building on previous work\nthat leverages the local structure of Horn clauses to simplify message passing,\nwe group messages to minimize warp divergence and better utilize GPU resources.\nExperimental results on datarace analysis over eight real-world Java programs\nshow that our approach achieves an average speedup of $2.14\\times$ over the\nstate-of-the-art sequential approach and $5.56\\times$ over the state-of-the-art\nGPU-based approach, while maintaining high accuracy."}

However, discrepancies between simulated and real-world behavior,\nknown as the reality gap, challenge the transferability of test results to\ndeployed systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study\ncomparing four representative testing modalities: Software-in-the-Loop (SiL),\nVehicle-in-the-Loop (ViL), Mixed-Reality (MR), and full real-world testing.\nUsing a small-scale physical vehicle equipped with real sensors (camera and\nLiDAR) and its digital twin, we implement each setup and evaluate two ADS\narchitectures (modular and end-to-end) across diverse indoor driving scenarios\ninvolving real obstacles, road topologies, and indoor environments. We\nsystematically assess the impact of each testing modality along three\ndimensions of the reality gap: actuation, perception, and behavioral fidelity.\nOur results show that while SiL and ViL setups simplify critical aspects of\nreal-world dynamics and sensing, MR testing improves perceptual realism without\ncompromising safety or control. Importantly, we identify the conditions under\nwhich failures do not transfer across testing modalities and isolate the\nunderlying dimensions of the gap responsible for these discrepancies. Our\nfindings offer actionable insights into the respective strengths and\nlimitations of each modality and outline a path toward more robust and\ntransferable validation of autonomous driving systems."}

Prior work tested abstract guidelines and general concrete steps;\nthe impact of context-specific instruction is unclear. We ran an eight-week\nlongitudinal study with four conditions: no instruction (G1), abstract\nguidelines (G2), concrete steps (G3), and our context-specific instruction that\npairs concrete bug-localization steps with problem-specific details (G4).\nForty-four undergraduates participated; 41 completed all five sessions (S1-S5).\nEach session included 2-3 debugging tasks to identify the minimal code element\ncontaining a seeded logical fault. We measured correctness (binary), time to\ncompletion, self-perceived scores (stress, difficulty, satisfaction, and\nstrategy adherence). G4 achieved higher correctness and shorter time to\ncompletion: it reached 80% correctness after one session (vs. 20-44% for other\ngroups) and maintained 80% after three weeks, outperforming all groups (p <\n0.05); its time to completion stabilized at 13-15 minutes in S1, whereas other\ngroups took 2-3 sessions to stabilize at 22-27 minutes. Qualitative responses\nshowed lower stress and higher satisfaction in G4, with participants\ninternalizing strategies via contextual examples. We conclude that\ncontext-specific instruction yields faster skill acquisition and stronger\nretention than abstract guidelines or context-agnostic steps. Even 1-2 sessions\nproduced significant gains, while extended practice optimized and stabilized\nperformance. Integrating contextual examples with abstract principles may\nbridge theory-practice gaps in bug-localization education and provide a more\nequitable path for novices."}

Existing approaches based on\nreinforcement learning or large language models (LLMs) exhibit limitations in\nsuch scenarios. They struggle to infer unobserved steps and reconstruct the\nunderlying user action sequences to navigate the vast UI interaction space,\nprimarily due to limited goal-directed reasoning and planning. We present\nTreeMind, a novel technique that integrates LLMs with a customized Monte Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS) algorithm to achieve strategic UI exploration in bug\nreproduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine\nexternal decision-making with LLM semantic reasoning for reliable bug\nreproduction. We formulate the reproduction task as a target-driven search\nproblem, leveraging MCTS as the core planning mechanism to iteratively refine\naction sequences. To enhance MCTS with semantic reasoning, we introduce two\nLLM-guided agents with distinct roles: Expander generates top-k promising\nactions based on the current UI state and exploration history, while Simulator\nestimates the likelihood that each action leads toward successful reproduction.\nBy incorporating multi-modal UI inputs and advanced prompting techniques,\nTreeMind conducts feedback-aware navigation that identifies missing but\nessential user actions and incrementally reconstructs the reproduction paths.\nWe evaluate TreeMind on a dataset of 93 real-world Android bug reports from\nthree widely-used benchmarks. Experimental results show that it significantly\noutperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in reproduction success rate. A\nreal-world case study indicates that integrating LLM reasoning with MCTS-based\nplanning is a compelling direction for automated bug reproduction."}

Existing approaches largely overlook these custom allocators,\nleading to coarse aliasing and reduced analysis precision. In this paper, we\npresent AFD, a novel technique that enhances pointer analysis by automatically\nidentifying and modeling custom allocation functions. AFD employs a hybrid\napproach: it uses value-flow analysis to detect straightforward wrappers and\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason about more complex allocation\npatterns with side effects. This targeted enhancement enables precise modeling\nof heap objects at each call site, achieving context-sensitivity-like benefits\nwithout the associated overhead. We evaluate AFD on 15 real-world C projects,\nidentifying over 600 custom AFs. Integrating AFD into a baseline pointer\nanalysis yields a 26x increase in modeled heap objects and a 39% reduction in\nalias set sizes, with only 1.4x runtime overhead. Furthermore, our enhanced\nanalysis improves indirect call resolution and uncovers 17 previously\nundetected memory bugs. These results demonstrate that precise modeling of\ncustom allocation functions offers a scalable and practical path to improving\npointer analysis in large software systems."}
