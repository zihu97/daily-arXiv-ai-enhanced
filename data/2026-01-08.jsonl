Polyphony is designed to be complementary to other adaptive mechanisms like congestion control and traffic engineering, but targets different aspects of network operation that have previously been considered static. By contrast to Polyphony, prior model-free optimization methods work best when there are only a few relevant degrees of freedom and where workloads and measurements are stable, assumptions not present in modern data center networks.\n  Polyphony develops novel methods for measuring, predicting, and controlling network quality of service metrics for a dynamically changing workload. First, we monitor and aggregate workloads on a network-wide basis; we use the result as input to an approximate counterfactual prediction engine that estimates the effect of potential network configuration changes on network quality of service; we apply the best candidate and repeat in a closed-loop manner aimed at rapidly and stably converging to a configuration that meets operator goals. Using CloudLab on a simple topology, we observe that Polyphony converges to tight SLOs within ten minutes, and re-stabilizes after large workload shifts within fifteen minutes, while the prior state of the art fails to adapt."}

Particularly, incentive mechanisms are able to take into account rationality and other behavior of human users into account, which guarantees benefits/utility of all system entities, thereby improving the scalability, adaptability, and fairness in resource allocation.

With the evolving of Industrial 4.0, dynamic and bursty tasks with varied Quality of Service (QoS); effective management and utilization of growing number of mobile equipments become two major challenges for network solutions. The existing TSCH-based networks lack of a system framework design to handle these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel, service-oriented, and hierarchical IoT network architecture named Mobile Node as a Service (Monaas). Monaas aims to systematically manage and schedule mobile nodes as on-demand, elastic resources through a new architectural design and protocol mechanisms. Its core features include a hierarchical architecture to balance global coordination with local autonomy, task-driven scheduling for proactive resource allocation, and an on-demand mobile resource integration mechanism. The feasibility and potential of the Monaas link layer mechanisms are validated through implementation and performance evaluation on an nRF52840 hardware testbed, demonstrating its potential advantages in specific scenarios. On a physical nRF52840 testbed, Monaas consistently achieved a Task Completion Rate (TCR) above 98% for high-priority tasks under bursty traffic and link degradation, whereas all representative baselines (Static TSCH, 6TiSCH Minimal, OST, FTS-SDN) remained below 40%.Moreover, its on-demand mobile resource integration activated services in 1.2 s, at least 65% faster than SDN (3.5 s) and OST/6TiSCH (> 5.8 s)."}

In such scenarios, NTNs, and specifically UAVs, are promising candidates to provide on-demand and rapid connectivity on the ground, serving as aerial base stations. In this paper, we implement a setup in which a rotary-wing UAV, equipped with a Starlink Mini terminal, provides Internet connectivity to an emergency ground user in the absence of cellular coverage via LEO satellites. The UAV functions as a Wi-Fi access point, while backhauling the ground traffic through the Starlink constellation. We evaluate the system via both network simulations in ns-3 and real-world flight experiments in a rural environment, in terms of throughput, latency, coverage, and energy consumption under static and dynamic flight conditions. Our results demonstrate that the system can maintain a stable uplink throughput of approximately 30 Mbps up to approximately 200 meters, and with minimal impact on the UAV battery lifetime. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of deploying commercial LEO satellite terminals on UAVs as a practical solution for emergency connectivity."}

In pursuit of low latency, some recently proposed BFT consensus protocols employ a leaderless optimistic fast path, in which clients broadcast their requests directly to replicas without first serializing requests at a leader, resulting in an end-to-end commit latency of 2 message delays ($2Δ$) during fault-free, synchronous periods. However, such a fast path only works if there is no contention: concurrent contending requests can cause replicas to diverge if they receive conflicting requests in different orders, triggering costly recovery procedures.\n  In this work, we present Aspen, a leaderless BFT protocol that achieves a near-optimal latency of $2Δ+ \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ indicates a short waiting delay. Aspen removes the no-contention condition by utilizing a best-effort sequencing layer based on loosely synchronized clocks and network delay estimates. Aspen requires $n = 3f + 2p + 1$ replicas to cope with up to $f$ Byzantine nodes. The $2p$ extra nodes allow Aspen's fast path to proceed even if up to $p$ replicas diverge due to unpredictable network delays. When its optimistic conditions do not hold, Aspen falls back to PBFT-style protocol, guaranteeing safety and liveness under partial synchrony. In experiments with wide-area distributed replicas, Aspen commits requests in less than 75 ms, a 1.2 to 3.3$\\times$ improvement compared to previous protocols, while supporting 19,000 requests per second."}

However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who\" and ``what\" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments.

We analyze how the team adapted Scrum practices (sprint structure, roles, backlog management) to fit semester rhythms, exams, travel, and part-time availability, and how communication and coordination were maintained in a hybrid on-site/remote environment. Using qualitative observations and artifacts from Discord, Notion, and GitHub, as well as contribution metrics and a custom communication effectiveness index (score: 0.76/1.00), we evaluate three dimensions: (1) the effectiveness of collaboration tools, (2) the impact of hybrid work on communication and productivity, and (3) the feasibility of aligning Scrum with academic timelines. Our findings show that (i) lightweight, tool-mediated coordination enabled stable progress even during remote periods; (ii) one-week sprints and flexible ceremonies helped reconcile Scrum with academic obligations; and (iii) shared motivation, role clarity, and compatible working styles were as critical as process mechanics.

Under optimistic conditions, Majorum finalizes blocks in as few as three slots while requiring only a single voting phase per slot.

Three real-world case studies are tested in controlled, containerised pilots in telecommunications security, national heritage asset management, and utilities customer service automation. Initial empirical results show that, for these case studies, prototypes were delivered within two weeks and pilot-ready solutions within one month, suggesting reduced development overhead compared to conventional approaches and improved user accessibility.

Today, cell (re)selection parameters are typically configured manually based on operator experience and rarely adapted to dynamic network conditions.

We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework called CellPilot that adaptively tunes cell (re)selection parameters by learning spatiotemporal patterns of mobile network dynamics. Our study with real-world data demonstrates that even a lightweight RL agent can outperform conventional heuristic reconfigurations by up to 167%, while generalizing effectively across different network scenarios.

However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays. Experimental results show that our framework enables GPU-NDP systems to achieve 2.41x on average and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, significantly enhancing MoE inference efficiency in resource-constrained environments."}

The platform integrates ChromLLM, a domain-specific LLM trained for chromatography, along with a multi-agent system and an automated chromatographic experimental device. The multi-agent system comprises four agents: domain knowledge answering, experimental design, experimental execution, and data analysis. ChromR enables automatic completion of the entire workflow-including initial process parameter recommendation, experimental design, automated execution, data analysis, and multi-objective optimization. By utilizing ChromR, dependency on expert knowledge is effectively reduced, while labor input and development time are significantly decreased.

This deployment bottleneck limits reproducibility, large-scale evaluation, and the practical integration of scientific tools into modern AI-for-Science (AI4S) and agentic workflows.\n  We present Deploy-Master, a one-stop agentic workflow for large-scale tool discovery, build specification inference, execution-based validation, and publication. Guided by a taxonomy spanning 90+ scientific and engineering domains, our discovery stage starts from a recall-oriented pool of over 500,000 public repositories and progressively filters it to 52,550 executable tool candidates under license- and quality-aware criteria. Deploy-Master transforms heterogeneous open-source repositories into runnable, containerized capabilities grounded in execution rather than documentation claims. In a single day, we performed 52,550 build attempts and constructed reproducible runtime environments for 50,112 scientific tools. Each successful tool is validated by a minimal executable command and registered in SciencePedia for search and reuse, enabling direct human use and optional agent-based invocation.\n  Beyond delivering runnable tools, we report a deployment trace at the scale of 50,000 tools, characterizing throughput, cost profiles, failure surfaces, and specification uncertainty that become visible only at scale. These results explain why scientific software remains difficult to operationalize and motivate shared, observable execution substrates as a foundation for scalable AI4S and agentic science."}

A Study of Tests in Agentic Pull Requests", "comment": null, "summary": "Testing is a critical practice for ensuring software correctness and long-term maintainability. As agentic coding tools increasingly submit pull requests (PRs), it becomes essential to understand how testing appears in these agent-driven workflows. Using the AIDev dataset, we present an empirical study of test inclusion in agentic pull requests. We examine how often tests are included, when they are introduced during the PR lifecycle and how test-containing PRs differ from non-test PRs in terms of size, turnaround time, and merge outcomes. Across agents, test-containing PRs are more common over time and tend to be larger and take longer to complete, while merge rates remain largely similar. We also observe variation across agents in both test adoption and the balance between test and production code within test PRs. Our findings provide a descriptive view of testing behavior in agentic pull requests and offer empirical grounding for future studies of autonomous software development."}

This paper presents \\textit{VSM--GQM--DevOps}, a unified, traceable framework that integrates (i) Value Stream Mapping (VSM) to visualize the end-to-end delivery system and quantify delays, rework, and handoffs, (ii) the Goal--Question--Metric (GQM) paradigm to translate stakeholder objectives into a minimal, decision-relevant measurement model (combining DORA with project and team outcomes), and (iii) maturity-aligned DevOps automation to remediate empirically observed bottlenecks through small, reversible interventions. The framework operationalizes traceability from observed waste to goal-aligned questions, metrics, and automation candidates, and provides a defensible prioritization approach that balances expected impact, confidence, and cost. We also define a multi-site, longitudinal mixed-method validation protocol that combines telemetry-based quasi-experimental analysis (interrupted time series and, where feasible, controlled rollouts) with qualitative triangulation from interviews and retrospectives. The expected contribution is a validated pathway and a set of practical instruments that enables organizations to select automation investments that demonstrably improve both delivery performance and project-management outcomes."}

However, due to their data-driven and pattern-seeking nature, ML algorithms may develop decision logic that disproportionately distributes opportunities, benefits, resources, or information among different population groups, potentially harming marginalized communities. In response to such fairness concerns, the software engineering and ML communities have made significant efforts to establish the best practices for creating fair ML software. These include fairness interventions for training ML models, such as including sensitive features, selecting non-sensitive attributes, and applying bias mitigators. But how reliably can software professionals tasked with developing data-driven systems depend on these recommendations? And how well do these practices generalize in the presence of faulty labels, missing data, or distribution shifts? These questions form the core theme of this paper."}

These tasks are operationally sensitive because small omissions or alterations can remain silent while producing syntactically valid programs. This paper introduces a deliberately minimal transcription-to-code benchmark to isolate this reliability concern in LLM-based code generation. Given a list of high-precision decimal constants, a model must generate Python code that embeds the constants verbatim and performs a simple aggregate computation. We describe the prompting variants, evaluation protocol based on exact-string inclusion, and analysis framework used to characterize state-tracking and long-horizon generation failures. The benchmark is intended as a compact stress test that complements existing code-generation evaluations by focusing on data integrity rather than algorithmic reasoning."}

Current benchmarks typically fluctuate between isolated code snippets and black-box evaluations. We present RepoReason, a white-box diagnostic benchmark centered on abductive assertion verification. To eliminate memorization while preserving authentic logical depth, we implement an execution-driven mutation framework that utilizes the environment as a semantic oracle to regenerate ground-truth states. Furthermore, we establish a fine-grained diagnostic system using dynamic program slicing, quantifying reasoning via three orthogonal metrics: $ESV$ (reading load), $MCL$ (simulation depth), and $DFI$ (integration width). Comprehensive evaluations of frontier models (e.g., Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus) reveal a prevalent aggregation deficit, where integration width serves as the primary cognitive bottleneck. Our findings provide granular white-box insights for optimizing the next generation of agentic software engineering."}

However, effective code generation requires models to understand and apply a wide range of language concepts. If the concepts exercised in benchmarks are not representative of those used in real-world projects, evaluations may yield incomplete. Despite this concern, the representativeness of code concepts in benchmarks has not been systematically examined.\n  To address this gap, we present the first empirical study that analyzes the representativeness of code generation benchmarks through the lens of Knowledge Units (KUs) - cohesive sets of programming language capabilities provided by language constructs and APIs. We analyze KU coverage in two widely used Python benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, and compare them with 30 real-world Python projects. Our results show that each benchmark covers only half of the identified 20 KUs, whereas projects exercise all KUs with relatively balanced distributions. In contrast, benchmark tasks exhibit highly skewed KU distributions.\n  To mitigate this misalignment, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework that synthesizes KU-based tasks to rebalance benchmark KU distributions and better align them with real-world usage. Using this framework, we generate 440 new tasks and augment existing benchmarks. The augmented benchmarks substantially improve KU coverage and achieve over a 60% improvement in distributional alignment. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on these augmented benchmarks reveal consistent and statistically significant performance drops (12.54-44.82%), indicating that existing benchmarks overestimate LLM performance due to their limited KU coverage. Our findings provide actionable guidance for building more realistic evaluations of LLM code-generation capabilities."}

However, when applied to socially sensitive decisions such as team composition and task allocation, they raise concerns of fairness. Prior studies have revealed that LLMs may reproduce stereotypes; however, these analyses remain exploratory and examine sensitive attributes in isolation. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit bias in team composition and task assignment by analyzing the combined effects of candidates' country and pronouns. Using three LLMs and 3,000 simulated decisions, we find systematic disparities: demographic attributes significantly shaped both selection likelihood and task allocation, even when accounting for expertise-related factors. Task distributions further reflected stereotypes, with technical and leadership roles unevenly assigned across groups. Our findings indicate that LLMs exacerbate demographic inequities in software engineering contexts, underscoring the need for fairness-aware assessment."}

However, the diversity caused by the constant evolution of the ML ecosystem (e.g., algorithms, libraries, datasets) makes this task challenging. Existing approaches either depend on non-scalable, manual labeling, or on ML classifiers that do not properly support the diversity of the domain. These limitations highlight the need for more flexible and reliable solutions.\n  Objective: We evaluate whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can leverage their code understanding and classification abilities to address these limitations, and subsequently how they can advance our understanding of data science practices.\n  Method: We conduct a confirmatory study based on two reference works selected for their relevance regarding current state-of-the-art's limitations. First, we compare several SLMs using Cochran's Q test. The best-performing model is then evaluated against the reference studies using two distinct McNemar's tests. We further analyze how variations in taxonomy definitions affect performance through an additional Cochran's Q test. Finally, a goodness-of-fit analysis is conducted using Pearson's chi-squared tests to compare our insights on data science practices with those from prior studies."}

These privileges reduce the default isolation provided by containers and introduce significant security risks. Security risk identification for OT container deployments is challenged by hybrid IT/OT architectures, fragmented stakeholder knowledge, and continuous system changes. Existing approaches lack reproducibility, interpretability across contexts, and technical integration with deployment artefacts. We propose a model-based approach, implemented as the Container Security Risk Ontology (CSRO), which integrates five key domains: adversarial behaviour, contextual assumptions, attack scenarios, risk assessment rules, and container security artefacts. Our evaluation of CSRO in a case study demonstrates that the end-to-end formalisation of risk calculation, from artefact to risk level, enables automated and reproducible risk identification. While CSRO currently focuses on technical, container-level treatment measures, its modular and flexible design provides a solid foundation for extending the approach to host-level and organisational risk factors."}

While researchers have extensively analysed ITS data to automate or assist specific activities such as issue assignments, duplicate detection, or priority prediction, developer studies on ITSs remain rare. Particularly, little is known about the challenges Software Engineering (SE) teams encounter in ITSs and when certain practices and workarounds (such as leaving issue fields like \"priority\" empty) are considered problematic. To fill this gap, we conducted an in-depth interview study with 26 experienced SE practitioners from different organisations and industries. We asked them about general problems encountered, as well as the relevance of 31 ITS smells (aka potentially problematic practices) discussed in the literature. By applying Thematic Analysis to the interview notes, we identified 14 common problems including issue findability, zombie issues, workflow bloat, and lack of workflow enforcement. Participants also stated that many of the ITS smells do not occur or are not problematic. Our results suggest that ITS problems and smells are highly dependent on context factors such as ITS configuration, workflow stage, and team size. We also discuss potential tooling solutions to configure, monitor, and visualise ITS smells to cope with these challenges."}
