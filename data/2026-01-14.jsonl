Code available at https://github.com/Govcraft/latin-experiment", "summary": "Current multi-agent LLM frameworks rely on explicit orchestration patterns borrowed from human organizational structures: planners delegate to executors, managers coordinate workers, and hierarchical control flow governs agent interactions. These approaches suffer from coordination overhead that scales poorly with agent count and task complexity. We propose a fundamentally different paradigm inspired by natural coordination mechanisms: agents operate locally on a shared artifact, guided only by pressure gradients derived from measurable quality signals, with temporal decay preventing premature convergence. We formalize this as optimization over a pressure landscape and prove convergence guarantees under mild conditions.\n  Empirically, on Latin Square constraint satisfaction across 1,078 trials, pressure-field coordination matches hierarchical control (38.2% vs 38.8% aggregate solve rate, p=0.94, indicating statistical equivalence). Both significantly outperform sequential (23.3%), random (11.7%), and conversation-based multi-agent dialogue (8.6%, p<0.00001). Temporal decay is essential: disabling it increases final pressure 49-fold (d=4.15). On easy problems, pressure-field achieves 87% solve rate. The approach maintains consistent performance from 2 to 32 agents. Our key finding: implicit coordination through shared pressure gradients achieves parity with explicit hierarchical control while dramatically outperforming explicit dialogue-based coordination. This suggests that constraint-driven emergence offers a simpler, equally effective foundation for multi-agent AI."}

To reduce the dominant prefill cost in such pipelines, recent work advocates KV cache reuse across partially shared contexts and reports substantial speedups for generation agents. In this work, we show that these efficiency gains do not transfer uniformly to judge-centric inference. Across GSM8K, MMLU, and HumanEval, we find that reuse strategies that are effective for execution agents can severely perturb judge behavior: end-task accuracy may appear stable, yet the judge's selection becomes highly inconsistent with dense prefill. We quantify this risk using Judge Consistency Rate (JCR) and provide diagnostics showing that reuse systematically weakens cross-candidate attention, especially for later candidate blocks. Our ablation further demonstrates that explicit cross-candidate interaction is crucial for preserving dense-prefill decisions. Overall, our results identify a previously overlooked failure mode of KV cache reuse and highlight judge-centric inference as a distinct regime that demands dedicated, risk-aware system design."}

An Agent Contract unifies input/output specifications, multi-dimensional resource constraints, temporal boundaries, and success criteria into a coherent governance mechanism with explicit lifecycle semantics. For multi-agent coordination, we establish conservation laws ensuring delegated budgets respect parent constraints, enabling hierarchical coordination through contract delegation. Empirical validation across four experiments demonstrates 90% token reduction with 525x lower variance in iterative workflows, zero conservation violations in multi-agent delegation, and measurable quality-resource tradeoffs through contract modes. Agent Contracts provide formal foundations for predictable, auditable, and resource-bounded autonomous AI deployment."}

Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios."}

It is known to be NP-hard. Still, many tools exist to find sub-optimal circuits to implement a function. In electronics, such tools are known as synthesisers. However, these synthesisers aim to implement very large functions (a whole electronic chip). In cryptography, the focus is on small functions, hence the necessity for new dedicated tools for small functions. Several tools exist to implement small functions. They differ by their algorithmic approach (some are based on Depth-First-Search as introduced by Ullrich in 2011, some are based on SAT-solvers like the tool desgined by Stoffelen in 2016, some non-generic tools use subfield decomposition) and by their optimisation criteria (some optimise for circuit size, others for circuit depth, and some for side-channel-protected implementations). However, these tools are limited to functions operating on less than 5 bits, sometimes 6 bits for quadratic functions, or to very simple functions. The limitation lies in a high computing time. We propose a new tool (The tool is provided alongside the IEEE article with CodeOcean and at https://github.com/seduval/implem-quad-sbox) to implement quadratic functions up to 9 bits within AND-depth 1, minimising the number of AND gates. This tool is more time-efficient than previous ones, allowing to explore larger implementations than others on 6 bits or less and allows to reach larger sizes, up to 9 bits."}

A Pareto-Front Analysis of DNN Partitioning for Edge Inference", "comment": null, "summary": "The deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is frequently hindered by their significant computational and memory requirements. While partitioning and distributing a DNN across multiple devices is a well-established strategy to mitigate this challenge, prior research has largely focused on single-objective optimization, such as minimizing latency or maximizing throughput. This paper challenges that view by reframing DNN partitioning as a multi-objective optimization problem. We argue that in real-world scenarios, a complex trade-off between latency and throughput exists, which is further complicated by network variability. To address this, we introduce ParetoPipe, an open-source framework that leverages Pareto front analysis to systematically identify optimal partitioning strategies that balance these competing objectives.\n  Our contributions are threefold: we benchmark pipeline partitioned inference on a heterogeneous testbed of Raspberry Pis and a GPU-equipped edge server; we identify Pareto-optimal points to analyze the latency-throughput trade-off under varying network conditions; and we release a flexible, open-source framework to facilitate distributed inference and benchmarking. This toolchain features dual communication backends, PyTorch RPC and a custom lightweight implementation, to minimize overhead and support broad experimentation."}

However, the rising operational energy consumption has emerged as a critical bottleneck and a major sustainability concern. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a well-known technique used to reduce energy consumption, and thus improve energy-efficiency, since it requires little effort and works with existing hardware. Reducing the energy consumption of training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) through DVFS or power capping is feasible: related work has shown energy savings can be significant, but at the cost of significant slowdowns. In this work, we focus on reducing waste in LLM operations: i.e., reducing energy consumption without losing performance. We propose a fine-grained, kernel-level, DVFS approach that explores new frequency configurations, and prove these save more energy than previous, pass- or iteration-level solutions. For example, for a GPT-3 training run, a pass-level approach could reduce energy consumption by 2% (without losing performance), while our kernel-level approach saves as much as 14.6% (with a 0.6% slowdown). We further investigate the effect of data and tensor parallelism, and show our discovered clock frequencies translate well for both. We conclude that kernel-level DVFS is a suitable technique to reduce waste in LLM operations, providing significant energy savings with negligible slow-down."}

The system features a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terrestrial base station (BS) and explores both monostatic and bistatic radar configurations to enable joint communication and sensing. In the monostatic configuration, both the transmitter and receiver are at the same location, while the bistatic configuration separates the transmitter and receiver spatially. System performance is evaluated using Fisher Information (FI) to quantify sensing accuracy and Mutual Information (MI) to measure communication efficiency. To achieve an optimal balance between communication and sensing, the RIS reflective coefficients and BS transmit beamforming are jointly optimized by maximizing a weighted sum of FI and MI. A novel solution approach is proposed for a single-user, single-object scenario, leveraging the mutual coupling model to enhance system realism. The impact of self-interference on sensing performance is also investigated through signal quantization. Numerical results reveal a fundamental trade-off between FI and MI and demonstrate that incorporating mutual coupling within a physically-consistent framework significantly improves both communication and sensing performance compared to conventional RIS-assisted JCAS models. Additionally, the analysis highlights how the choice of monostatic versus bistatic radar configuration affects system performance, offering valuable insights for the design of RIS-assisted JCAS systems."}

We present an integrated beamforming approach for JCAS in a multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system. The performance measures for communication and sensing are Fisher information (FI) and mutual information (MI). Our research considers two scenarios: multiple communication users with a single sensing object and a single communication user with a single sensing object. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum of MI and FI, subject to a total transmit power budget for both cases. As a particular case, we address the equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) for the single communication user scenario. We use the uplink-downlink duality for the multi-user case to simplify the problem and apply Lagrangian optimization and line search methods with a block-coordinate ascending technique. We use projected gradient descent (PGD) to solve the optimization problem in the single-user case. Our numerical results demonstrate that joint beamforming is optimal for the multi-user JCAS system, as opposed to independent beamforming for each user and the sensing object.

This shift opens a pathway for new cognitive challenges that amplify existing decision-making biases or create entirely novel ones. One such type of challenge stems from cognitive biases, which are thinking patterns that lead people away from logical reasoning and result in sub-optimal decisions. How do cognitive biases manifest and impact decision-making in emerging AI-collaborative development? This paper presents the first comprehensive study of cognitive biases in LLM-assisted development. We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining observational studies with 14 student and professional developers, followed by surveys with 22 additional developers. We qualitatively compare categories of biases affecting developers against the traditional non-LLM workflows. Our findings suggest that LLM-related actions are more likely to be associated with novel biases. Through a systematic analysis of 90 cognitive biases specific to developer-LLM interactions, we develop a taxonomy of 15 bias categories validated by cognitive psychologists. We found that 48.8% of total programmer actions are biased, and developer-LLM interactions account for 56.4% of these biased actions. We discuss how these bias categories manifest, present tools and practices for developers, and recommendations for LLM tool builders to help mitigate cognitive biases in human-AI programming."}

However, unleashing this potential requires bridging the critical gap between abstract reasoning and physical actuation, a capability we term tool intelligence. In this article, we explore the landscape of tool engineering to empower agentic AI in communications. We first analyze the functionalities of tool intelligence and its effects on communications. We then propose a systematic review for tool engineering, covering the entire lifecycle from tool creation and discovery to selection, learning, and benchmarking. Furthermore, we present a case study on tool-assisted uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) trajectory planning to demonstrate the realization of tool intelligence in communications. By introducing a teacher-guided reinforcement learning approach with a feasibility shield, we enable agents to intelligently operate tools. They utilize external tools to eliminate navigational uncertainty while mastering cost-aware scheduling under strict energy constraints. This article aims to provide a roadmap for building the tool-augmented intelligent agents of the 6G era."}

However, due to memory constraints, MoE models with billions or even trillions of parameters can only be deployed in multi-GPU or even multi-node & multi-GPU based serving systems. Thus, communication has became a major bottleneck in distributed serving systems, especially inter-node communication. Contemporary distributed MoE models are primarily implemented using all-reduce (AR) based tensor parallelism (TP) and all-to-all (A2A) based expert parallelism (EP). However, TP generally exhibits low inter-node efficiency and is thus confined to high-speed intra-node bandwidth. In contrast, EP tends to suffer from load imbalance, especially when the parallel degree is high.\n  In this work, we introduce MixServe, a novel automatic distributed serving system for efficient deployment of MoE models by a novel TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm. MixServe begins by evaluating the communication overhead associated with various parallel strategies, taking into account the model hyperparameters and the configurations of network and hardware resources, and then automatically selects the most efficient parallel strategy. Then, we propose the TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm that overlaps intra-node AR communication and inter-node A2A communication. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3 models demonstrate that MixServe achieves superior inference performance, with 1.08~3.80x acceleration in time to first token (TTFT), 1.03~1.66x acceleration in inter-token latency (ITL), and 5.2%~50.3% throughput improvement compared to existing approaches."}

To address this issue, we present a novel test prioritization framework that reduces redundancy while preserving geometric and behavioral diversity. Road scenarios are clustered based on geometric and dynamic features of the ADAS driving behavior, from which representative cases are selected to guarantee coverage. Roads are finally prioritized based on geometric complexity, driving difficulty, and historical failures, ensuring that the most critical and challenging tests are executed first. We evaluate our framework on the OPENCAT dataset and the Udacity self-driving car simulator using two ADAS models. On average, our approach achieves an 89% reduction in test suite size while retaining an average of 79% of failed road scenarios. The prioritization strategy improves early failure detection by up to 95x compared to random baselines."}

We present a detailed statistical analysis of end-to-end latency based on 500Hz experimental bidirectional one-way measurements and introduce a segmentation of the deterministic 15-second periodic behavior observed in Starlink. We characterize handover-induced boundary regions that produce latency spikes lasting approximately 140 ms at the beginning and 75 ms at the end of each cycle, followed by a stable intra-period regime, enabling accurate short-term prediction. This analysis shows that latency prediction based on long-term statistics leads to pessimistic estimates. In contrast, by exploiting the periodic structure, isolating boundary regions, and applying lightweight parametric and non-parametric models to intra-period latency distributions, we achieve 99th-percentile latency prediction errors below 50 ms. Furthermore, period-level latency prediction and classification enable adaptive transmission strategies by identifying upcoming periods where application latency requirements cannot be satisfied, necessitating the use of alternative systems."}

Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios."}

Objective: This paper explores the incorporation of code-specific and general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate critical software security tasks, such as identifying vulnerabilities, predicting severity and access complexity, and generating fixes as a proof of concept. Method: We evaluate five pairs of recent LLMs, including both code-based and general-purpose open-source models, on two recognized C/C++ vulnerability datasets, namely Big-Vul and Vul-Repair. Additionally, we compare fine-tuning and prompt-based approaches. Results: The results show that fine-tuning uniformly outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot approaches across all tasks and models. Notably, code-specialized models excel in zero-shot and few-shot settings on complex tasks, while general-purpose models remain nearly as effective. Discrepancies among CodeBLEU, CodeBERTScore, BLEU, and ChrF highlight the inadequacy of current metrics for measuring repair quality. Conclusions: This study contributes to the software security community by investigating the potential of advanced LLMs to improve vulnerability analysis and remediation."}

The methodology comprised architectural design, smart contract development, and the implementation of a web-based interface, followed by functional, security, performance, and usability evaluations. Experimental results show that the system correctly supports certificate issuance and public verification, enforces access control, and resists common misuse scenarios. Performance analysis indicates low confirmation latency and negligible transaction costs, making the solution suitable for large-scale academic environments. Additionally, usability assessment using the System Usability Scale (SUS) resulted in a score of 76.67, indicating good user acceptance.

These manuals, written in natural language, describe many steps in detail. Unfortunately, the number, magnitude, and articulation of these descriptions can significantly slow down and complicate the retrieval of the correct procedure during critical incidents. Interestingly, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables the development of tools based on conversational interfaces that can assist operators in their retrieval tasks, improving their capability to respond to incidents. This paper presents the results of a set of experiments that derive from the analysis of the troubleshooting procedures available in Fincantieri, a large international company developing complex naval cyber-physical systems. Results show that RAG can assist operators in reacting promptly to failure symptoms, although specific measures have to be taken into consideration to cross-validate recommendations before actuating them."}

We observe that NLC deviates from core principles of coverage criteria, such as monotonicity and test suite order independence, and could more fully account for key properties of the covariance matrix. Additionally, we note threats to the validity of the empirical study, related to the ground truth ordering of test suites. Through our empirical validation, we substantiate our claims and propose improvements for future DNN coverage metrics. Finally, we conclude by discussing the implications of these insights."}

This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal.\n  Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases. Query latency is similar for No-Graph and DKB, while LLM-KB is slower and more variable. On the Shopizer question suite, DKB achieves the highest correctness, LLM-KB is close behind, and the vector-only baseline performs worst on upstream architectural queries and has the highest hallucination risk. Overall, deterministic AST-derived graphs provide more reliable coverage and multi-hop grounding than LLM-extracted graphs at substantially lower indexing cost."}
