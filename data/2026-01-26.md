### [1] [Space Filling Curves is All You Need: Communication-Avoiding Matrix Multiplication Made Simple](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16294)
*Evangelos Georganas,Alexander Heinecke,Pradeep Dubey*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出用空间填充曲线（SFC）优化矩阵乘法，解决针对平台和形状依赖的调参问题，实现高数据局部性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矩阵乘法是深度学习和高性能计算的基础，但其优化依赖平台配置和矩阵形状，易导致性能瓶颈（如'玻璃颌'），需低开销的方法降低调参复杂性。

Method: 采用广义希尔伯特曲线将多维坐标转换为一维分区，提升数据局部性；扩展到通信避免算法，复制输入张量以最小化临界路径上的数据移动。

Result: 实现代码精简（约30行），在多个CPU平台媲渡违伦础测试中，几何平均加速比优于厂商库高达2倍。

Conclusion: SFC方法提供了平台无关、形状无关的矩阵乘法方案，显著提升性能并简化实现。

Abstract: General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is the cornerstone of Deep Learning and HPC workloads; accordingly, academia and industry have heavily optimized this kernel. Modern platforms with matrix multiplication accelerators exhibit high FLOP/Byte machine balance, which makes implementing optimal matrix multiplication challenging. On modern CPU platforms with matrix engines, state-of-the-art vendor libraries tune input tensor layouts, parallelization schemes, and cache blocking to minimize data movement across the memory hierarchy and maximize throughput. However, the best settings for these parameters depend strongly on the target platform (number of cores, memory hierarchy, cache sizes) and on the shapes of the matrices, making exhaustive tuning infeasible; in practice this leads to performance "glass jaws". In this work we revisit space filling curves (SFC) to alleviate the problem of this cumbersome tuning. SFC convert multi-dimensional coordinates (e.g. 2D) into a single dimension (1D), keeping nearby points in the high-dimensional space close in the 1D order. We partition the Matrix Multiplication computation space using recent advancements in generalized SFC (Generalized Hilbert Curves), and we obtain platform-oblivious and shape-oblivious matrix-multiplication schemes that exhibit inherently high degree of data locality. Furthermore, we extend the SFC-based work partitioning to implement Communication-Avoiding (CA) algorithms that replicate the input tensors and provably minimize communication/data-movement on the critical path. The integration of CA-algorithms is seamless and yields compact code (~30 LOC), yet it achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple CPU platforms, outperforming vendor libraries by up to 2x(geometric-mean speedup) for a range of GEMM shapes.

### [2] [Consensus In Asynchrony](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16460)
*Ivan Klianev*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文证实基于事件同步在解决异步可靠共识问题上的可行性，提出抗单点崩溃的向量协议算法，确保安全性和活性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协调FLP不可能性定理的局限性，通过分析共识协议类型和FLP隐含假设探索确定性共识的可能性

Method: 区分数据无关/数据相关两类协议，揭示FLP定理依赖三个隐含假设（前两点影响数据相关共识，第三点为关键）并通过实验证伪第三假设

Result: 算法实现容错的确定性向量共识，实验表明FLP定理的第三假设缺乏依据

Conclusion: 事件同步机制可突破FLP理论限制，为异步容错共识提供新解决方案

Abstract: We demonstrate sufficiency of events-based synchronisation for solving deterministic fault-tolerant consensus in asynchrony. Main result is an algorithm that terminates with valid vector agreement, hence operates with safety, liveness, and tolerance to one crash. Reconciling with the FLP impossibility result, we identified: i) existence of two types of agreements: data-independent and data-dependent; and ii) dependence of FLP theorem correctness on three implicit assumptions. Consensus impossibility with data-dependent agreement is contingent on two of them. The theorem-stated impossibility with every agreement type hinges entirely on the third. We provide experimental results showing that the third assumption has no evidence in support.

### [3] [W4A16 Mixed-Precision Matrix Multiplication on Decoupled Architecture: Kernel Design and Memory Bottleneck Analysis for Ascend NPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16536)
*Yuanhong He,Peiyu Niu,Jun Chen,Chenchen Zhang,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了专为华为Ascend 910 NPU设计的4-bit权重16-bit激活矩阵乘法核心，优化大型语言模型量化部署，提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Ascend 910 NPU上部署W4A16量化面临原生混合精度支持不足和解耦架构挑战，需解决高效执行问题。

Method: 结合向量核心实现INT4转FP16解量化、立方核心处理高吞吐GEMM运算，并采用Split-K并行策略减少内存延迟。

Result: 在K>>N场景下，相比数据并行方法实现1.01x-1.74x加速，但权重全局内存传输为主瓶颈，量化仅提高1.48x性能上限(response based on PyTorch FP16基准)。

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale, weight-only quantization (W4A16: 4-bit weights, 16-bit activations) becomes critical for reducing memory footprint with minimal accuracy loss. However, its efficient deployment on Huawei's Ascend 910 Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is challenging due to limited native mixed-precision support and the accelerator's decoupled compute architecture. To enable quantization on such architecture, we present the first practical W4A16 matrix multiplication kernel tailored for the Ascend 910 NPU. Our design leverages vector cores for on-the-fly INT4-to-FP16 dequantization, cube cores for high-throughput GEMM, and Split-K parallelization to mitigate memory latency. Performance evaluations across diverse matrix shapes and batch sizes show our method outperforms data-parallel approaches when K >> N, a typical scenario in LLM decoding. Specially, our method can achieve a speedup ranging from 1.01x to 1.74x. In addition, our profile reveals the primary bottleneck is not dequantization compution itself, but extra global memory transfer for the weight, making W4A16 only reaching a maximum speedup of 1.48x over native FP16xFP16 matrix multiplication in PyTorch. In the long run, our method lays a solid foundation and provides insightful views for the efficient deployment of quantized large language models on various domain-specific accelerators.

### [4] [GPU-Accelerated Selected Basis Diagonalization with Thrust for SQD-based Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16637)
*Jun Doi,Tomonori Shirakawa,Yukio Kawashima,Seiji Yunoki,Hiroshi Horii*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出基于Thrust库的GPU加速SBD方案， بودن关键组件重构后实现了CPU方案最高40倍的加速效果，显著提升量子-经典计算流程性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SBD在SQD迭代中占主导计算负荷，需优化其性能瓶颈；通过GPU并行化加速经典计算部分以提升整体计算效率。

Method: 整合Thrust库GPU并行原语，重构构型处理、激发生成和矩阵运算三个核心模块，采用扁平化数据结构适配GPU架构。

Result: 实验显示Thrust-SBD相较CPU实现最高提速约40倍，大幅降低SQD迭代总耗时。

Conclusion: GPU原生并行方案为量子-经典混合计算提供了简洁、可移植且高效的技术基础。

Abstract: Selected Basis Diagonalization (SBD) plays a central role in Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD), where iterative diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in selected configuration subspaces forms the dominant classical workload. We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of SBD using the Thrust library. By restructuring key components -- including configuration processing, excitation generation, and matrix-vector operations -- around fine-grained data-parallel primitives and flattened GPU-friendly data layouts, the proposed approach efficiently exploits modern GPU architectures. In our experiments, the Thrust-based SBD achieves up to $\sim$40$\times$ speedup over CPU execution and substantially reduces the total runtime of SQD iterations. These results demonstrate that GPU-native parallel primitives provide a simple, portable, and high-performance foundation for accelerating SQD-based quantum-classical workflows.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid growth of Large Transformer-based models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), now scaling to trillions of parameters, has necessitated training across thousands of GPUs using complex hybrid parallelism strategies (e.g., data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism). Checkpointing this massive, distributed state is critical for a wide range of use cases, such as resilience, suspend-resume, investigating undesirable training trajectories, and explaining model evolution. However, existing checkpointing solutions typically treat model state as opaque binary blobs, ignoring the ``3D heterogeneity'' of the underlying data structures--varying by memory location (GPU vs. Host), number of ``logical'' objects sharded and split across multiple files, data types (tensors vs. Python objects), and their serialization requirements. This results in significant runtime overheads due to blocking device-to-host transfers, data-oblivious serialization, and storage I/O contention. In this paper, we introduce DataStates-LLM, a novel checkpointing architecture that leverages State Providers to decouple state abstraction from data movement. DataStates-LLM exploits the immutability of model parameters during the forward and backward passes to perform ``lazy'', non-blocking asynchronous snapshots. By introducing State Providers, we efficiently coalesce fragmented, heterogeneous shards and overlap the serialization of metadata with bulk tensor I/O. We evaluate DataStates-LLM on models up to 70B parameters on 256 A100-40GB GPUs. Our results demonstrate that DataStates-LLM achieves up to 4$\times$ higher checkpointing throughput and reduces end-to-end training time by up to 2.2$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions, effectively mitigating the serialization and heterogeneity bottlenecks in extreme-scale LLM training.

*Wei Wei,Jingye Xu,Sahidul Islam,Dakai Zhu,Chen Pan,Mimi Xie*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出AERO系统，一种面向能量收集物联网设备的运行时感知OTA更新机制，解决间歇性能源下更新效率与一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OTA更新依赖重启且开销大，现有实时更新缺乏运行时一致性保障，不适用于间歇供电系统。

Method: 将更新任务整合至设备DAG中，识别更新影响区域并动态调整依赖，在能量/时序约束下与常规任务协同调度。

Result: 实验证明相比现有方法显著提升更新可靠性与效率。

Conclusion: AERO通过自适应依赖管理确保更新一致性，适配间歇性能源环境。

Abstract: Energy-harvesting (EH) Internet of Things (IoT) devices operate under intermittent energy availability, which disrupts task execution and makes energy-intensive over-the-air (OTA) updates particularly challenging. Conventional OTA update mechanisms rely on reboots and incur significant overhead, rendering them unsuitable for intermittently powered systems. Recent live OTA update techniques reduce reboot overhead but still lack mechanisms to ensure consistency when updates interact with runtime execution. This paper presents AERO, an Adaptive and Efficient Runtime-Aware OTA update mechanism that integrates update tasks into the device's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and schedules them alongside routine tasks under energy and timing constraints. By identifying update-affected execution regions and dynamically adjusting dependencies, AERO ensures consistent up date integration while adapting to intermittent energy availability. Experiments on representative workloads demonstrate improved update reliability and efficiency compared to existing live update approaches.

### [7] [Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Collective Action and Loyalty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16237)
*Vik Pant,Eric Yu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文针对混合动机多智能体协作中的搭便车问题，提出忠诚度调节的效用函数框架，通过实验和案例验证机制有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合动机环境下个体努力集体受益却独自承担成本导致普遍搭便车现象，现有i*理论缺乏合作竞争场景的计算分析机制

Method: 开发忠诚度调节效用函数（含福利内在化-贡献满足的忠诚收益+降低努力负担的成本容忍），通过依赖加权的团队凝聚力整合i*结构，连接成员激励与团队定位

Result: 3125次实验显示忠诚度效应显著（努力差异中值提升15.04倍），六项行为指标全部达标（达标率96.5%-100%）。Apache HTTP Server案例实证60/60分，重现全生命周期贡献模式（p<0.001，Cohen's d=0.71）

Conclusion: 忠诚度机制成功解决协作困境，为人类团队与多智能体系统提供基于心理认同和计算调整的统一框架，实现团队激励与绩效提升

Abstract: Mixed-motive multi-agent settings are rife with persistent free-riding because individual effort benefits all members equally, yet each member bears the full cost of their own contribution. Classical work by Holmström established that under pure self-interest, Nash equilibrium is universal shirking. While i* represents teams as composite actors, it lacks scalable computational mechanisms for analyzing how collective action problems emerge and resolve in coopetitive settings. This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%). Empirical validation using published Apache HTTP Server (1995-2023) case study achieves 60/60 points, reproducing contribution patterns across formation, growth, maturation, and governance phases. Statistical significance confirmed at p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.71.

Abstract: Emerging safety-critical Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications require networks to proactively adapt to rapid environmental changes rather than merely reacting to them. While Network Digital Twins (NDTs) offer a pathway to such predictive capabilities, existing solutions typically struggle to reconcile high-fidelity physical modeling with strict real-time constraints. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end real-time V2X Digital Twin framework that integrates live mobility tracking with deterministic channel simulation. By coupling the Tokyo Mobility Digital Twin-which provides live sensing and trajectory forecasting-with VaN3Twin-a full-stack simulator with ray tracing-we enable the prediction of network performance before physical events occur. We validate this approach through an experimental proof-of-concept deployed in Tokyo, Japan, featuring connected vehicles operating on 60 GHz links. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to predict Received Signal Strength (RSSI) with a maximum average error of 1.01 dB and reliably forecast Line-of-Sight (LoS) transitions within a maximum average end-to-end system latency of 250 ms, depending on the ray tracing level of detail. Furthermore, we quantify the fundamental trade-offs between digital model fidelity, computational latency, and trajectory prediction horizons, proving that high-fidelity and predictive digital twins are feasible in real-world urban environments.

### [9] [Identifying Concurrency Bug Reports via Linguistic Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16338)
*Shuai Shao,Lu Xiao,Tingting Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于语言模式的框架，自动识别并发错误报告（如数据竞争和死锁），通过整合语言特征微调预训练语言模型达到高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多核架构普及сол，并发하여系统问题日益复杂，手动标记错误报告费时费力且易出错，亟 chaoticå 需自动化解决。

Method: 从730份人工标记报告中提取58种语言模式（涵盖单词、短语、句子和报告层面），综合评估匹配、学习、提示和微调等方法，最终使用领域语言知识微调预训练语言模型。

Result: 在12个大规模开源项目（GitHub和Jira的10,920份报告）中测试ا，微调模型精度达GitHub91%、Jira93%，后期截断数据精度保持91%。

Conclusion: 贡献包括并发错误语言特征分类体系、知识注入微调策略及标签化数据集，提升分类自动化、精度和可解释性，为后续研究奠定基础。

Abstract: With the growing ubiquity of multi-core architectures, concurrent systems have become essential but increasingly prone to complex issues such as data races and deadlocks. While modern issue-tracking systems facilitate the reporting of such problems, labeling concurrency-related bug reports remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. This paper presents a linguistic-pattern-based framework for automatically identifying concurrency bug reports. We derive 58 distinct linguistic patterns from 730 manually labeled concurrency bug reports, organized across four levels: word-level (keywords), phrase-level (n-grams), sentence-level (semantic), and bug report-level (contextual). To assess their effectiveness, we evaluate four complementary approaches-matching, learning, prompt-based, and fine-tuning-spanning traditional machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and pre-trained language models (PLMs). Our comprehensive evaluation on 12 large-scale open-source projects (10,920 issue reports from GitHub and Jira) demonstrates that fine-tuning PLMs with linguistic-pattern-enriched inputs achieves the best performance, reaching a precision of 91% on GitHub and 93% on Jira, and maintaining strong precision on post cut-off data (91%). The contributions of this work include: (1) a comprehensive taxonomy of linguistic patterns for concurrency bugs, (2) a novel fine-tuning strategy that integrates domain-specific linguistic knowledge into PLMs, and (3) a curated, labeled dataset to support reproducible research. Together, these advances provide a foundation for improving the automation, precision, and interpretability of concurrency bug classification.

*Mary Shaw,Mary Lou Maher,Keith Webster*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究针对软件工程研究中评审积压、指标驱动动机、发表扭曲等系统性问题，提出复杂系统和变革理论的整体框架，探索协调改革杠杆点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是揭示软件工程研究生态中的结构性问题，如同行评审过载、AI压力和欺诈行为，这些因素分散研究对社会角色的贡献，阻碍实质性进展

Method: 方法基于复杂系统、生态系统和变革理论，构建系统级视角分析非线性反馈循环和功能障碍根源

Result: 沂果显沂了现有问题由非线性反馈循环维沂，且识别了生态系统协调改革的杠杆点，重点探索联动修复而非孤立措施 attends

Conclusion: 结论强调，有效改革需从生态系统层面整合跨领域协调行动，以解决软件工程研究的深层次结构问题

Abstract: The software engineering research community is productive, yet it faces a constellation of challenges: swamped review processes, metric-driven incentives, distorted publication practices, and increasing pressures from AI, scale, and outright scams. These issues are often treated in isolation, yet they arise from deep structural dynamics within the research ecosystem itself and distract us from the larger role of research in society. Meaningful progress requires a holistic system-level view. We sketch such a framework drawing on ideas from complex systems, ecosystems, and theory of change. Reframing SE's challenges through this lens reveals non-linear feedback loops that sustain current dysfunctions, and it helps to identify leverage points for reform. These are less a matter of isolated fixes and more a matter of exploring coordinated sets of fixes that operate across the SE ecosystem

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究团队ొ了RubberDuckBench——一个源自GitHub拉取请求的多语言代码问答基准，评估20款LLMs后发现顶尖模型仍无法可靠答对问题，存在高比例错误虚构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需科学的基准评测AI编程助手性能，理解其在真实场景能力不足。

Method: 从GitHub拉取评论中构建多语言基准，制定评估细则，测试20款开源与闭源LLMs的回答质量。

Result: 最优模型Grok 4/Claude Opus 4/GPT-5正确率不足70%，模型间无显著差异；58.3%回答存在虚构，且性能与成本无关。

Conclusion: 该基准为可信AI编程助手的研发提供目标，揭示当前技术仍有重大缺陷。

Abstract: Programmers are turning to AI coding assistants to answer questions about their code. Benchmarks are needed to soundly evaluate these systems and understand their performance. To enable such a study, we curate a benchmark of real-world contextualized questions derived from Github pull request comments. Out of this work, we present RubberDuckBench: a multilingual benchmark of questions about code, along with detailed rubrics for evaluating answers. We evaluate a diverse set of 20 LLMs (proprietary & open-source) on answering these questions. We find that even state of the art models fail to give consistent, correct responses across the benchmark. Grok 4 (69.29%), Claude Opus 4 (68.5%), and GPT-5 (67.8%) perform best overall, but do not exhibit pairwise significant superiority over the next 9 best performing models. Most models obtain points through partial credit, with the best performing models only answering at most 2 questions completely correctly across all trials. Furthermore, models often hallucinate with lies in 58.3\% of responses on average. Cost analysis reveals no correlation between expense (API pricing or parameter count) and performance. We intend this benchmark to be a target for future research in trustworthy and correct AI coding assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源生态系统如NPM和PyPI面临日益增多的供应链攻击，现有方法依赖脆弱的手工规则或无法适应攻击语义演化的数据驱动特征，亟需更可靠、可解释的检测方案。

Method: 构建基于8千份威胁情报报告的结构化知识库，关联恶意代码片段与行为描述及专家推理；分析新包时，通过检索语义相似的恶意案例并应用LLM引导推理，评估代码行为是否偏离预期功能。

Result: 对4027个真实软件包的测试显示，IntelGuard准确率达99%，误报率为0.50%，在混淆代码上保持96.5%准确率；部署于PyPI.org时发现54个先前未报告的恶意包。

Conclusion: IntelGuard整合专家知识，提供了一种高度可靠、可解释且稳健的恶意包检测框架，有效应对供应链攻击的演变，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Open-source ecosystems such as NPM and PyPI are increasingly targeted by supply chain attacks, yet existing detection methods either depend on fragile handcrafted rules or data-driven features that fail to capture evolving attack semantics. We present IntelGuard, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based framework that integrates expert analytical reasoning into automated malicious package detection. IntelGuard constructs a structured knowledge base from over 8,000 threat intelligence reports, linking malicious code snippets with behavioral descriptions and expert reasoning. When analyzing new packages, it retrieves semantically similar malicious examples and applies LLM-guided reasoning to assess whether code behaviors align with intended functionality. Experiments on 4,027 real-world packages show that IntelGuard achieves 99% accuracy and a 0.50% false positive rate, while maintaining 96.5% accuracy on obfuscated code. Deployed on PyPI.org, it discovered 54 previously unreported malicious packages, demonstrating interpretable and robust detection guided by expert knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏细粒度行为分析 Moses视劳务困难导致配置失败，需解决大规模环境配置低效问题。

Method: 结合专家诊断模块进行执行后细粒度分析，设计自进化机制实时动态调整错误修复优先级 Moses视劳务困难实现多智能体协同配置。

Result: 在420个存储库上匹配SOTA方法；在更难的Envbench上成功率达78.1%(领先7.1%) Moses视劳务困难在错误识别和修复建议方面表现更优。

Conclusion: EvoConfig为LLM软件开发任务提供高效可靠的环境配置 Moses视劳务困难在复杂场景和调试能力上显著超越现有技术。

Abstract: A reliable executable environment is the foundation for ensuring that large language models solve software engineering tasks. Due to the complex and tedious construction process, large-scale configuration is relatively inefficient. However, most methods always overlook fine-grained analysis of the actions performed by the agent, making it difficult to handle complex errors and resulting in configuration failures. To address this bottleneck, we propose EvoConfig, an efficient environment configuration framework that optimizes multi-agent collaboration to build correct runtime environments. EvoConfig features an expert diagnosis module for fine-grained post-execution analysis, and a self-evolving mechanism that lets expert agents self-feedback and dynamically adjust error-fixing priorities in real time. Empirically, EvoConfig matches the previous state-of-the-art Repo2Run on Repo2Run's 420 repositories, while delivering clear gains on harder cases: on the more challenging Envbench, EvoConfig achieves a 78.1% success rate, outperforming Repo2Run by 7.1%. Beyond end-to-end success, EvoConfig also demonstrates stronger debugging competence, achieving higher accuracy in error identification and producing more effective repair recommendations than existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码翻译基准测试缺失注释，无法有效评估其对翻译质量的影响，需填补该研究空白。

Method: 在C/C++/Go/Java/Python五种语言上，通过两个基准测试对1100+代码样本进行超8万次带注释与无注释翻译对比实验。

Result: 代码注释（尤其是描述整体功能的注释）可显著提升翻译准确率；COMMENTRA新方法使基于LLM的翻译性能最高翻倍。

Conclusion: 该研究首次大规模验证注释对代码翻译的关键作用，为LLM翻译优化提供了新方向和方法支撑。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era in automated code translation across programming languages. Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in terms of its comprehensiveness, scale, and language coverage on how to improve code translation accuracy using code comments.

Abstract: The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development highlights the importance of energy-efficient software to reduce the global carbon footprint. Programming languages and execution models strongly influence software energy consumption, with interpreted languages generally being less efficient than compiled ones. Lua illustrates this trade-off: despite its popularity, it is less energy-efficient than greener and faster languages such as C.
  This paper presents an empirical study of Lua's runtime performance and energy efficiency across 25 official interpreter versions and just-in-time (JIT) compilers. Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter. Moreover, LuaJIT approaches C's efficiency, using roughly six times more energy and running about eight times slower, demonstrating the substantial benefits of JIT compilation for improving both performance and energy efficiency in interpreted languages.

Abstract: Stakeholders often struggle to accurately express their requirements due to articulation barriers arising from limited domain knowledge or from cognitive constraints. This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements. By keeping stakeholders in the validation loop, this approach promotes responsible and trustworthy use of AI in Requirements Engineering.

Conclusion: 总结了一系列可操作启示供开发者、组织和工具供应商参考，助力推进人工智能辅助的软件开发。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have seen rapid adoption among software developers. While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier. We summarize a set of actionable implications for developers, organizations, and tool vendors seeking to advance artificial intelligence (AI) assisted software development.

Motivation: 改进 REST API 设计的经验理解，以应对现有指南过于庞大或不实用的问题，因为低质量的 API 可能威胁业务成功。

Method: 通过访谈 16 位行业内的 REST API 专家，探讨 API 可用性、指南有效性因素、采纳挑战和最佳实践。

Result: 确定影响 API 可用性的八个因素，其中遵循约定最为重要；开发者对严格指南有阻力，指南大小和组织适应性是关键；组合自动化 linting 工具可强制执行并提供教育支持。

Conclusion: REST 指南需随组织演变，所有利益相关者应参与开发维护；自动化工具可提升指南执行效率和用户体验。

Abstract: REST is today's most widely used architectural style for providing web-based services. In the age of service-orientation (a.k.a. Software as a Service (SaaS)) APIs have become core business assets and can easily expose hundreds of operations. While well-designed APIs contribute to the commercial success of a service, poorly designed APIs can threaten entire organizations. Recognizing their relevance and value, many guidelines have been proposed for designing usable APIs, similar to design patterns and coding standards. For example, Zalando and Microsoft provide popular REST API guidelines. However, they are often considered as too large and inapplicable, so many companies create and maintain their own guidelines, which is a challenge in itself. In practice, however, developers still struggle to design effective REST APIs. To improve the situation, we need to improve our empirical understanding of adopting, using, and creating REST API guidelines.
  We present an interview study with 16 REST API experts from industry. We determine the notion of API usability, guideline effectiveness factors, challenges of adopting and designing guidelines, and best practices. We identified eight factors influencing REST API usability, among which the adherence to conventions is the most important one. While guidelines can in fact be an effective means to improve API usability, there is significant resistance from developers against strict guidelines. Guideline size and how it fits with organizational needs are two important factors to consider. REST guidelines also have to grow with the organization, while all stakeholders need to be involved in their development and maintenance. Automated linting provides an opportunity to not only embed compliance enforcement into processes, but also to justify guideline rules with educational explanations.

Abstract: LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in software development, but their performance is hampered by long interaction contexts, which incur high API costs and latency. While various context compression approaches such as LongLLMLingua have emerged to tackle this challenge, they typically rely on fixed metrics such as PPL, ignoring the task-specific nature of code understanding. As a result, they frequently disrupt syntactic and logical structure and fail to retain critical implementation details. In this paper, we propose SWE-Pruner, a self-adaptive context pruning framework tailored for coding agents. Drawing inspiration from how human programmers "selectively skim" source code during development and debugging, SWE-Pruner performs task-aware adaptive pruning for long contexts. Given the current task, the agent formulates an explicit goal (e.g., "focus on error handling") as a hint to guide the pruning targets. A lightweight neural skimmer (0.6B parameters) is trained to dynamically select relevant lines from the surrounding context given the goal. Evaluations across four benchmarks and multiple models validate SWE-Pruner's effectiveness in various scenarios, achieving 23-54% token reduction on agent tasks like SWE-Bench Verified and up to 14.84x compression on single-turn tasks like LongCodeQA with minimal performance impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编译器一次只分析单一配置，现有变异性感知工具设置复杂且成本高，导致错误难以检测。

Method: 评估GPT-OSS-20B和GEMINI 3 PRO，与TYPECHEF对比，使用5000个小型系统（含误差和无误差）及14个GitHub真实提交，附加42个变异测试场景。

Result: GPT-OSS-20B在小型系统检测中精度0.97、召回率0.90、准确度0.94；修复成功率超70%。CHATGPT-5.2在真实提交中检测出几乎所有故障，还发现一个潜在Linux编译错误。

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern software systems often rely on conditional compilation to support optional features and multiple deployment scenarios. In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines. Our findings indicate that current state-of-the-art foundation models provide a practical and low-effort complement to traditional variability-aware analyses.

TL;DR: 研究证明AI助手生成的代码比人类代码存活时间更长（修改率低15.8%），推翻了'一次性代码'假说，但发现修复率略高且修改时机预测困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对软件工程界认为AI生成的代码会被快速废弃的假说进行验证，避免组织将维护负担转移到部署后修复阶段。

Method: 通过生存分析法研究201个开源项目中20余万条AI与人类编写的代码单元，比较修改率、修复率和适应率差异。

Result: AI代码存活优势明显（风险比HR=0.842, p<0.001），但修复率更高（26.3%vs23.0%）；文本特征可预测易修改代码（AUC=0.671），但修改时机预测困难（F1=0.285）。

Conclusion: AI代码的瓶颈不在生成质量，而在于组织管理其长期演进的实践机制。

Abstract: The integration of AI agents as coding assistants into software development has raised questions about the long-term viability of AI agent-generated code. A prevailing hypothesis within the software engineering community suggests this code is "disposable", meaning it is merged quickly but discarded shortly thereafter. If true, organizations risk shifting maintenance burden from generation to post-deployment remediation. We investigate this hypothesis through survival analysis of 201 open-source projects, tracking over 200,000 code units authored by AI agents versus humans. Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p < 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cramér's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics. The bottleneck for agent-generated code may not be generation quality, but the organizational practices that govern its long-term evolution.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI coding agents for software development has raised important questions about the quality and maintainability of the code they produce. While prior studies have examined AI-generated source code, the impact of AI coding agents on build systems-a critical yet understudied component of the software lifecycle-remains largely unexplored. This data mining challenge focuses on AIDev, the first large-scale, openly available dataset capturing agent-authored pull requests (Agentic-PRs) from real-world GitHub repositories. Our paper leverages this dataset to investigate (RQ1) whether AI coding agents generate build code with quality issues (e.g., code smells), (RQ2) to what extent AI agents can eliminate code smells from build code, and (RQ3) to what extent Agentic-PRs are accepted by developers. We identified 364 maintainability and security-related build smells across varying severity levels, indicating that AI-generated build code can introduce quality issues-such as lack of error handling, and hardcoded paths or URLs-while also, in some cases, removing existing smells through refactorings (e.g., Pull Up Module and Externalize Properties). Notably, more than 61\% of Agentic-PRs are approved and merged with minimal human intervention. This dual impact underscores the need for future research on AI-aware build code quality assessment to systematically evaluate, guide, and govern AI-generated build systems code.

TL;DR: 提出选择性代码覆盖率检测方法，解决AAA游戏测试中的性能开销和稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全量代码覆盖检测在AAA游戏中会带来过高性能开销，破坏自动化测试稳定性。

Method: 针对大型C++游戏引擎设计选择性检测框架，集成到工业测试流水线中，缩减检测范围但保留提交相关覆盖数据。

Result: 编译开销极小（2000次提交后构建时间才翻倍），最差性能仍保持50%以上帧率，两个生产测试集实现零失败。

Conclusion: 该方法能以接近零开销实现大型C++游戏引擎的提交/构建级覆盖检测，且不损害测试稳定性。

Abstract: Code coverage is a valuable guide for testing, but in AAA games the overhead of instrumentation conflicts with strict performance requirements and can destabilize automated tests. We propose and assess a selective instrumentation approach tailored to large game engines written in \texttt{C++}, which reduces the scope of instrumentation while preserving relevant coverage data to developer commits. Our framework integrates into an industrial game testing pipeline, enabling developers to receive immediate coverage feedback on tests run against their changes. The compilation overhead of our approach is minimal, allowing instrumentation of over 2,000 commits before doubling build time. In performance evaluations, even the worst-case scenario maintains frame rates above 50\% of the non-instrumented baseline. Across two production test suites maintained by our industry partner, our framework caused no automated test failures, avoiding the instability observed under full instrumentation. Our work shows that commit-level or build-level coverage of large \texttt{C++} game engines can be achieved with minimal overhead and without compromising test stability.
