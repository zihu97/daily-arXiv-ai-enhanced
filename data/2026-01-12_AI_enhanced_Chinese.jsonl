However, the computational cost of PSRO has become a significant limitation to its practical application. Our analysis shows that game simulation is the primary bottleneck in PSRO's runtime. To address this issue, we conclude the concept of Simulation-Free PSRO and summarize existing methods that instantiate this concept. Additionally, we propose a novel Dynamic Window-based Simulation-Free PSRO, which introduces the concept of a strategy window to replace the original strategy set maintained in PSRO. The number of strategies in the strategy window is limited, thereby simplifying opponent strategy selection and improving the robustness of the best response. Moreover, we use Nash Clustering to select the strategy to be eliminated, ensuring that the number of strategies within the strategy window is effectively limited. Our experiments across various environments demonstrate that the Dynamic Window mechanism significantly reduces exploitability compared to existing methods, while also exhibiting excellent compatibility.

A recently proposed auction-based parking assignment can alleviate cruising for parking and also set a market-driven, demand-responsive parking price. However, the wide acceptance of such a system is far from certain.\n  To evaluate the merits of auction-based parking assignment, we assume that drivers have access to a smartphone-based reservation system prior to its mandatory introduction and thus have the opportunity to test and experience its merits voluntarily. We set our experiment as Eclipse SUMO simulations with different rates of participants and non-participants to check how different market penetration levels affect the traffic flow, the performance of the auction-based assignment system, and the financial outcomes. The results show that the auction-based system improves traffic flow with increasing penetration rates, allowing participants to park gradually closer to their preferred parking lots. However, it comes with a price; the system also increases parking expenditures for participants. Interestingly, non-participating drivers will face even higher parking prices. Consequently, they will be motivated to use the new system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u62cd\u5356\u5f0f\u505c\u8f66\u5206\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u9884\u7ea6\u6539\u5584\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u5e76\u6fc0\u52b1\u975e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u52a0\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u505c\u8f66\u8d39\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u62cd\u5356\u5f0f\u505c\u8f66\u5206\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4ea4\u901a\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a5\u53d7\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Eclipse SUMO\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u5e02\u573a\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u4e0b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e0e\u975e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u8f66\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u652f\u51fa\u589e\u52a0\uff1b\u975e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d39\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u88ab\u6fc0\u52b1\u52a0\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62cd\u5356\u5f0f\u505c\u8f66\u5206\u914d\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u63a8\u52a8\u666e\u53ca\u3002"}}

RRAM based in memory computing suffers from scalability limitations due to device non idealities and fixed array sizes. Decentralized AI frameworks struggle with memory efficiency across NAT constrained networks due to static routing that ignores computational load. Multi agent deployment systems tightly couple application logic with execution environments, preventing adaptive memory optimization. These challenges stem from a fundamental lack of coordinated memory management across architectural layers. We introduce Self Evolving Distributed Memory Architecture for Scalable AI Systems, a three layer framework that unifies memory management across computation, communication, and deployment. Our approach features (1) memory guided matrix processing with dynamic partitioning based on device characteristics, (2) memory aware peer selection considering network topology and computational capacity, and (3) runtime adaptive deployment optimization through continuous reconfiguration. The framework maintains dual memory systems tracking both long term performance patterns and short term workload statistics. Experiments on COCO 2017, ImageNet, and SQuAD show that our method achieves 87.3 percent memory utilization efficiency and 142.5 operations per second compared to Ray Distributed at 72.1 percent and 98.7 operations per second, while reducing communication latency by 30.2 percent to 171.2 milliseconds and improving resource utilization to 82.7 percent.

Given the potential Internet-wide adoption of BBR, we must also consider its robustness in network and system scenarios. One such scenario is Cloud-based Virtual Machine (VM) networking - highly relevant in today's CDN-centric Internet. Interestingly, previous work has shown significant performance problems of BBRv1-2 running in Xen VMs, with BBR performance dropping to almost zero when CPU credit is low. In this paper, we develop a framework for measuring TCP throughput under fully controlled CPU contention, which uses Linux deadline scheduling to emulate generalized CPU contention conditions. Our measurements reveal that - in stark contrast to Cubic! - BBR throughput can break down during CPU contention under any hypervisor and all tested BDP conditions. Characterizing this performance degradation on a fine-granular level, we show that CPU limited BBR senders are capped at very low throughput levels below 10-20 Mbps. This finding implies that an Internet-wide shift from Cubic to BBR could harm the Internet's overall robustness, if not deployed with caution. To detect and overcome CPU-limited throughput, we propose a minimal BBR patch which detects the problematic situation by monitoring inflight bytes and reacts by increasing the pacing rate to make better use of the available CPU time. We show that our BBR patch overcomes the throughput problem for the most critical cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86BBR\u62e5\u585e\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728CPU\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u63a7inflight\u5b57\u8282\u6570\u5e76\u8c03\u6574pacing rate\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740BBR\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4e91\u865a\u62df\u673a\u7b49\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfCubic\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5728CPU\u4e89\u7528\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eLinux deadline\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6a21\u62dfCPU\u4e89\u7528\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cfBBR\u5728\u4e0d\u540chypervisor\u548cBDP\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8865\u4e01\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u53d1\u9001\u901f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eBBR\u5728CPU\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u9aa4\u964d\u81f310-20Mbps\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u800c\u6240\u63d0\u8865\u4e01\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u541e\u5410\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u82e5\u4e0d\u52a0\u8c28\u614e\u90e8\u7f72\uff0cBBR\u5168\u9762\u66ff\u4ee3Cubic\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u6574\u4f53\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u8865\u4e01\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3CPU\u53d7\u9650\u74f6\u9888\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present SaFUZZ, a state-aware fuzzing pipeline that validates core behavior associated with state transitions, automated failsafes, and human operator interactions in sUAS applications operating under various timing conditions and environmental disturbances. We create fuzzing specifications to detect behavioral deviations, and then dynamically generate associated Fault Trees to visualize states, modes, and environmental factors that contribute to the failure, thereby helping project stakeholders to analyze the failure and identify its root causes.

However, existing FDG methods typically struggle with cross-client data heterogeneity and incur significant communication and computation overhead. To address these challenges, this paper presents a new FDG framework, dubbed FaST-PT, which facilitates local feature augmentation and efficient unseen domain adaptation in a distributed manner. First, we propose a lightweight Multi-Modal Style Transfer (MST) method to transform image embedding under text supervision, which could expand the training data distribution and mitigate domain shift. We then design a dual-prompt module that decomposes the prompt into global and domain prompts. Specifically, global prompts capture general knowledge from augmented embedding across clients, while domain prompts capture domain-specific knowledge from local data. Besides, Domain-aware Prompt Generation (DPG) is introduced to adaptively generate suitable prompts for each sample, which facilitates unseen domain adaptation through knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on four cross-domain benchmark datasets, e.g., PACS and DomainNet, demonstrate the superior performance of FaST-PT over SOTA FDG methods such as FedDG-GA and DiPrompt.

This structural inferiority is not a trivial issue; it directly impedes downstream testing activities by complicating automated test data generation and increasing the cognitive load for human engineers. This paper reframes basis path generation from a procedural search task into a declarative optimization problem. We introduce a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) framework designed to produce a complete basis path set that is globally optimal in its structural simplicity. Our framework includes two complementary strategies: a Holistic MIP model that guarantees a theoretically optimal path set, and a scalable Incremental MIP strategy for large, complex topologies. The incremental approach features a multi-objective function that prioritizes path simplicity and incorporates a novelty penalty to maximize the successful generation of linearly independent paths. Empirical evaluations on both real-code and large-scale synthetic Control Flow Graphs demonstrate that our Incremental MIP strategy achieves a 100\\% success rate in generating complete basis sets, while remaining computationally efficient.

In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner.

While code language models have shown significant advancements, the current models and benchmarks are confined to high-readability code, which contains sufficient semantic cues such as function and variable names. In the real world, however, code is often poorly structured or obfuscated, significantly degrading model performance. In this paper, we first empirically evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art language models on poor-readability code for the task of code summarization, focusing on (1) their effectiveness, (2) the impact of prompt engineering, and (3) the robustness of different variants. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models-including GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 experience a substantial performance drop when faced with poorly readable code, and that prompt engineering and reasoning-enhanced models offer limited improvements. Motivated by these findings, we propose RoFTCodeSum, a novel fine-tuning method that enhances the robustness of code summarization against poorly readable code. RoFTCodeSum marries the concepts of curriculum learning and meta-learning: based on the original dataset for fine-tuning, it creates curricular training sets, e.g., obfuscating function names and identifiers from the code, respectively, that have progressive difficulty in code comprehension. In each training step, the approach meta-updates the gradients using these progressively challenging datasets, thereby optimizing both accuracy and readability robustness simultaneously.

This shift introduces a new category of integration defects that arise not only from code errors but also from misaligned interactions among LLM-specific artifacts, including prompts, API calls, configurations, and model outputs. However, existing defect localization techniques are ineffective at identifying these LLM-specific integration defects because they fail to capture cross-layer dependencies across heterogeneous artifacts, cannot exploit incomplete or misleading error traces, and lack semantic reasoning capabilities for identifying root causes.\n  To address these challenges, we propose LIDL, a multi-agent framework for defect localization in LLM-integrated software. LIDL (1) constructs a code knowledge graph enriched with LLM-aware annotations that represent interaction boundaries across source code, prompts, and configuration files, (2) fuses three complementary sources of error evidence inferred by LLMs to surface candidate defect locations, and (3) applies context-aware validation that uses counterfactual reasoning to distinguish true root causes from propagated symptoms. We evaluate LIDL on 146 real-world defect instances collected from 105 GitHub repositories and 16 agent-based systems. The results show that LIDL significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines across all metrics, achieving a Top-3 accuracy of 0.64 and a MAP of 0.48, which represents a 64.1% improvement over the best-performing baseline.

However, existing techniques primarily generate regression oracles that predicate on the implemented behavior of the class under test. They do not address the oracle problem: the challenge of distinguishing correct from incorrect program behavior. With the rise of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a new opportunity to generate test oracles that reflect intended behavior. This positions LLMs as enablers of Promptware, where software creation and testing are driven by natural-language prompts. This paper presents an empirical study on the effectiveness of LLMs in generating test oracles that expose software failures. We investigate how different prompting strategies and levels of contextual input impact the quality of LLM-generated oracles.

While organizations increasingly adopt PaC tools, the software engineering community lacks an empirical understanding of how these tools are used in real-world development practices.\n  \\textbf{Objective:} This paper aims to bridge this gap by conducting the first large-scale study of PaC usage in open-source software. Our goal is to characterize how PaC tools are adopted, what purposes they serve, and what governance activities they support across diverse software ecosystems.\n  \\textbf{Method:} We analyzed 399 GitHub repositories using nine widely adopted PaC tools. Our mixed-methods approach combines quantitative analysis of tool usage and project characteristics with a qualitative investigation of policy files. We further employ a Large Language Model (LLM)--assisted classification pipeline, refined through expert validation, to derive a taxonomy of PaC usage consisting of 5 categories and 15 sub-categories.\n  \\textbf{Results:} Our study reveals substantial diversity in PaC adoption. PaC tools are frequently used in early-stage projects and are heavily oriented toward governance, configuration control, and documentation. We also observe emerging PaC usage in MLOps pipelines and strong co-usage patterns, such as between OPA and Gatekeeper.

These heuristics can be recomposed to support various activities (e.g., live programming or history usage navigation). While this system is powerful, it does not account for the repository structure when suggesting global names such as class names, class variables, or global variables. As a result, it does not prioritize classes within the same package or project, treating all global names equally. In this paper, we present a new heuristic that addresses this limitation. Our approach searches variable names in a structured manner: it begins with the package of the requesting class, then expands to other packages within the same repository, and finally considers the global namespace. We describe the logic behind this heuristic and evaluate it against the default semantic heuristic and one that directly queries the global namespace. Preliminary results indicate that the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) improves, confirming that package-awareness completions deliver more accurate and relevant suggestions than the previous flat global approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7fPharo\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u5f15\u64ce\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u5305\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u540d\u79f0\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Pharo\u8865\u5168\u5f15\u64ce\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u540d\u79f0\u4e00\u89c6\u540c\u4ec1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u65b0\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6309\u5c42\u7ea7\u641c\u7d22\uff1a\u4ece\u8bf7\u6c42\u7c7b\u6240\u5728\u5305\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u540c\u4ed3\u5e93\u5176\u4ed6\u5305\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u67e5\u8be2\u5168\u5c40\u547d\u540d\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5012\u6570\u6392\u540d\uff08MRR\uff09\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5305\u611f\u77e5\u8865\u5168\u6bd4\u539f\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u6241\u5e73\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

To facilitate the exchange and utilization of SBOMs, organizations such as the Linux Foundation and OWASP have proposed SBOM standards. Following standards, organizations have developed tools for generating and utilizing SBOMs. However, limited research has examined the adherence of these SBOM tools to standard specifications, a gap that could lead to compliance failures and disruptions in SBOM utilization. This paper presents the first large-scale, two-stage empirical analysis of the adherence gap, using our automated evaluation framework, SAP. The evaluation, comprising a baseline evaluation and a one-year longitudinal follow-up, covers 55,444 SBOMs generated by six SBOM tools from 3,287 real-world repositories. Our analysis reveals persistent, fundamental limitations in current SBOM tools: (1) inadequate compliance support with policy requirements; (2) poor tool consistencies, including inter-tool consistency rates as low as 7.84% to 12.77% for package detection across languages, and significant longitudinal inconsistency, where tools show low consistency with their own prior versions; and (3) mediocre to poor accuracy for detailed software information, e.g., accuracy of package licenses below 20%. We analyze the root causes of these gaps and provide practical solutions.

In software engineering (SE), these models now support diverse activities, accelerating automation and decision-making. Yet, evidence shows that these models can reproduce or amplify social biases, raising fairness concerns. Recent work on neuron editing has shown that internal activations in pre-trained transformers can be traced and modified to alter model behavior. Building on the concept of knowledge neurons, neurons that encode factual information, we hypothesize the existence of biased neurons that capture stereotypical associations within pre-trained transformers. To test this hypothesis, we build a dataset of biased relations, i.e., triplets encoding stereotypes across nine bias types, and adapt neuron attribution strategies to trace and suppress biased neurons in BERT models. We then assess the impact of suppression on SE tasks. Our findings show that biased knowledge is localized within small neuron subsets, and suppressing them substantially reduces bias with minimal performance loss. This demonstrates that bias in transformers can be traced and mitigated at the neuron level, offering an interpretable approach to fairness in SE.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6291\u5236\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u590d\u5236\u6216\u653e\u5927\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u4e5d\u7c7b\u504f\u89c1\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5f52\u56e0\u7b56\u7565\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u6291\u5236BERT\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002", "result": "\u504f\u89c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u5c11\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u89c1\u4e14\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u504f\u89c1\u53ef\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5c42\u9762\u88ab\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches are often built on heterogeneous frameworks (e.g., distinct scenario spaces, simulators, and ADSs), which require considerable effort to reuse and adapt across different settings. To address these challenges, we present Drivora, a unified and extensible infrastructure for search-based ADS testing built on the widely used CARLA simulator. Drivora introduces a unified scenario definition, OpenScenario, that specifies scenarios using low-level, actionable parameters to ensure compatibility with existing methods while supporting extensibility to new testing designs (e.g., multi-autonomous-vehicle testing). On top of this, Drivora decouples the testing engine, scenario execution, and ADS integration. The testing engine leverages evolutionary computation to explore new scenarios and supports flexible customization of core components. The scenario execution can run arbitrary scenarios using a parallel execution mechanism that maximizes hardware utilization for large-scale batch simulation.

In this paper, the AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM), an extension of the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), is introduced as a standardized, verifiable record of trained AI models and their environments. Our proof-of-concept platform, AIBoMGen, automates the generation of signed AIBOMs by capturing datasets, model metadata, and environment details during training. The training platform acts as a neutral, third-party observer and root of trust. It enforces verifiable AIBOM creation for every job.

Traditional documentation is often outdated or incomplete, making it difficult to derive accurate, context-specific explanations. Meanwhile, issue-tracking systems capture rich and continuously updated development knowledge, but their potential for explainability remains untapped. With this work, we are the first to apply a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for generating explanations from issue-tracking data. Our proof-of-concept system is implemented using open-source tools and language models, demonstrating the feasibility of leveraging structured issue data for explanation generation. Evaluating our approach on an exemplary project's set of GitHub issues, we achieve 90% alignment with human-written explanations. Additionally, our system exhibits strong faithfulness and instruction adherence, ensuring reliable and grounded explanations. These findings suggest that RAG-based methods can extend explainability beyond black-box ML models to a broader range of software systems, provided that issue-tracking data is available - making system behavior more accessible and interpretable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u95ee\u9898\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8f6f\u4ef6\u884c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe90%\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u6863\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u800c\u95ee\u9898\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8574\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efaRAG\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4eceGitHub\u95ee\u9898\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u793a\u4f8b\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u64b0\u5199\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fbe90%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5c06\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, software vendors often silently patch vulnerabilities with limited disclosure, where Security Patch Detection (SPD) comes to protect software assets. Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning. In addition, previous studies often obtain training and testing data from the same project for evaluation, which fails to reflect closed-source conditions. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{StriderSPD}}, a \\underline{Str}ucture-gu\\underline{ide}d joint \\underline{r}epresentation \\underline{SPD} framework of binary code that integrates a graph branch into a large language model (LLM), leveraging structural information to guide the LLM in identifying security patches. Our novel design of the adapters in the graph branch effectively aligns the representations between assembly code and pseudo-code at the LLM's token level. We further present a two-stage training strategy to address the optimization imbalance caused by the large parameter disparity between StriderSPD's two branches, which enables proper branch fitting. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct a binary SPD benchmark that is disjoint from prior datasets in both projects and domains and extensively evaluate StriderSPD on this benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "StriderSPD \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5b89\u5168\u8865\u4e01\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u5347\u95ed\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8865\u4e01\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5b89\u5168\u8865\u4e01\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u95ed\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa StriderSPD \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u6c47\u7f16\u4e0e\u4f2a\u4ee3\u7801\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8de8\u9879\u76ee\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cStriderSPD \u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "StriderSPD \u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u95ed\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u8865\u4e01\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, logical defects in DeFi staking could enable attackers to claim unwarranted rewards by manipulating reward amounts, repeatedly claiming rewards, or engaging in other malicious actions. To mitigate these threats, we conducted the first study focused on defining and detecting logical defects in DeFi staking. Through the analysis of 64 security incidents and 144 audit reports, we identified six distinct types of logical defects, each accompanied by detailed descriptions and code examples. Building on this empirical research, we developed SSR (Safeguarding Staking Reward), a static analysis tool designed to detect logical defects in DeFi staking contracts. SSR utilizes a large language model (LLM) to extract fundamental information about staking logic and constructs a DeFi staking model. It then identifies logical defects by analyzing the model and the associated semantic features. We constructed a ground truth dataset based on known security incidents and audit reports to evaluate the effectiveness of SSR. The results indicate that SSR achieves an overall precision of 92.31%, a recall of 87.92%, and an F1-score of 88.85%. Additionally, to assess the prevalence of logical defects in real-world smart contracts, we compiled a large-scale dataset of 15,992 DeFi staking contracts.
