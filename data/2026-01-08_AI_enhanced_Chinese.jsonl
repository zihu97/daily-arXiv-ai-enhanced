However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who\" and ``what\" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments.

Our findings show that (i) lightweight, tool-mediated coordination enabled stable progress even during remote periods; (ii) one-week sprints and flexible ceremonies helped reconcile Scrum with academic obligations; and (iii) shared motivation, role clarity, and compatible working styles were as critical as process mechanics.

However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays. Experimental results show that our framework enables GPU-NDP systems to achieve 2.41x on average and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, significantly enhancing MoE inference efficiency in resource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18GPU-NDP\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548MoE\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u9884\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3MoE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18GPU-NDP\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5747\u3001GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u53d6\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u62c6\u4e13\u5bb6\u53c2\u6570\u81f3\u591a\u4e2aNDP\u5355\u5143\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9884\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u524d\u52a0\u8f7d\u9ad8\u9891\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u5b9e\u73b02.41\u500d\u3001\u6700\u9ad82.56\u500d\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0bMoE\u6a21\u578b\u5728GPU-NDP\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 1,039 GitHub repositories, comprising 422 OSS4SG and 617 conventional OSS projects, to compare community structure, contributor engagement, and coding practices.

This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems.

While models trained in specialized domains like mathematics or coding have demonstrated remarkable advancements in logical reasoning, there remains a significant gap in evaluating their code generation capabilities. Existing benchmark datasets fall short in pinpointing specific strengths and weaknesses, impeding targeted enhancements in models' reasoning abilities to synthesize code. To bridge this gap, our paper introduces an innovative, pedagogical benchmarking method that mirrors the evaluation processes encountered in academic programming courses. We introduce CodeEval, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs across 24 distinct aspects of Python programming. The dataset covers three proficiency levels - beginner, intermediate, and advanced - and includes both class-based and function-based problem types with detailed problem specifications and comprehensive test suites. To facilitate widespread adoption, we also developed RunCodeEval, an open-source execution framework that provides researchers with a ready-to-use evaluation pipeline for CodeEval. RunCodeEval handles test execution, context setup, and metrics generation, enabling researchers to quickly obtain detailed insights into model strengths and weaknesses across complexity levels, problem types, and programming categories.

Furthermore, we design a language-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically prioritizes harder translation directions based on relative performance across sibling languages, mitigating optimization imbalance.

However, effective code generation requires models to understand and apply a wide range of language concepts. If the concepts exercised in benchmarks are not representative of those used in real-world projects, evaluations may yield incomplete. Despite this concern, the representativeness of code concepts in benchmarks has not been systematically examined.\n  To address this gap, we present the first empirical study that analyzes the representativeness of code generation benchmarks through the lens of Knowledge Units (KUs) - cohesive sets of programming language capabilities provided by language constructs and APIs. We analyze KU coverage in two widely used Python benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, and compare them with 30 real-world Python projects. Our results show that each benchmark covers only half of the identified 20 KUs, whereas projects exercise all KUs with relatively balanced distributions. In contrast, benchmark tasks exhibit highly skewed KU distributions.\n  To mitigate this misalignment, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework that synthesizes KU-based tasks to rebalance benchmark KU distributions and better align them with real-world usage. Using this framework, we generate 440 new tasks and augment existing benchmarks. The augmented benchmarks substantially improve KU coverage and achieve over a 60% improvement in distributional alignment. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on these augmented benchmarks reveal consistent and statistically significant performance drops (12.54-44.82%), indicating that existing benchmarks overestimate LLM performance due to their limited KU coverage.

However, when applied to socially sensitive decisions such as team composition and task allocation, they raise concerns of fairness. Prior studies have revealed that LLMs may reproduce stereotypes; however, these analyses remain exploratory and examine sensitive attributes in isolation. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit bias in team composition and task assignment by analyzing the combined effects of candidates' country and pronouns. Using three LLMs and 3,000 simulated decisions, we find systematic disparities: demographic attributes significantly shaped both selection likelihood and task allocation, even when accounting for expertise-related factors. Task distributions further reflected stereotypes, with technical and leadership roles unevenly assigned across groups. Our findings indicate that LLMs exacerbate demographic inequities in software engineering contexts, underscoring the need for fairness-aware assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56e2\u961f\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u654f\u611f\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u56e2\u961f\u6784\u6210\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df3000\u6b21\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u56fd\u7c4d\u4e0e\u4ee3\u8bcd\u7ec4\u5408\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u663e\u793a\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u9009\u62e9\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u9886\u5bfc\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u5e03\u5448\u73b0\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u4eba\u53e3\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, the diversity caused by the constant evolution of the ML ecosystem (e.g., algorithms, libraries, datasets) makes this task challenging. Existing approaches either depend on non-scalable, manual labeling, or on ML classifiers that do not properly support the diversity of the domain. These limitations highlight the need for more flexible and reliable solutions.\n  Objective: We evaluate whether Small Language Models (SLMs) can leverage their code understanding and classification abilities to address these limitations, and subsequently how they can advance our understanding of data science practices.\n  Method: We conduct a confirmatory study based on two reference works selected for their relevance regarding current state-of-the-art's limitations. First, we compare several SLMs using Cochran's Q test. The best-performing model is then evaluated against the reference studies using two distinct McNemar's tests. We further analyze how variations in taxonomy definitions affect performance through an additional Cochran's Q test.

These privileges reduce the default isolation provided by containers and introduce significant security risks. Security risk identification for OT container deployments is challenged by hybrid IT/OT architectures, fragmented stakeholder knowledge, and continuous system changes. Existing approaches lack reproducibility, interpretability across contexts, and technical integration with deployment artefacts. We propose a model-based approach, implemented as the Container Security Risk Ontology (CSRO), which integrates five key domains: adversarial behaviour, contextual assumptions, attack scenarios, risk assessment rules, and container security artefacts. Our evaluation of CSRO in a case study demonstrates that the end-to-end formalisation of risk calculation, from artefact to risk level, enables automated and reproducible risk identification. While CSRO currently focuses on technical, container-level treatment measures, its modular and flexible design provides a solid foundation for extending the approach to host-level and organisational risk factors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5CSRO\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "OT\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bb9\u5668\u6743\u9650\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5bfc\u81f4\u9694\u79bb\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6574\u5408\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u6a21\u578bCSRO\uff1a\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u5bb9\u5668\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eCSRO\u80fd\u4ece\u5de5\u4ef6\u5230\u98ce\u9669\u7ea7\u522b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "CSRO\u5f53\u524d\u805a\u7126\u5bb9\u5668\u7ea7\u6280\u672f\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5176\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u4e3b\u673a\u7ea7\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ea7\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While researchers have extensively analysed ITS data to automate or assist specific activities such as issue assignments, duplicate detection, or priority prediction, developer studies on ITSs remain rare. Particularly, little is known about the challenges Software Engineering (SE) teams encounter in ITSs and when certain practices and workarounds (such as leaving issue fields like \"priority\" empty) are considered problematic. To fill this gap, we conducted an in-depth interview study with 26 experienced SE practitioners from different organisations and industries. We asked them about general problems encountered, as well as the relevance of 31 ITS smells (aka potentially problematic practices) discussed in the literature. By applying Thematic Analysis to the interview notes, we identified 14 common problems including issue findability, zombie issues, workflow bloat, and lack of workflow enforcement. Participants also stated that many of the ITS smells do not occur or are not problematic. Our results suggest that ITS problems and smells are highly dependent on context factors such as ITS configuration, workflow stage, and team size. We also discuss potential tooling solutions to configure, monitor, and visualise ITS smells to cope with these challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c0826\u4f4d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa14\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u53ca31\u79cdITS\u5f02\u5473\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5de5\u5177\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u8865\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5f02\u5473\u5b9e\u8df5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u5bf926\u4f4d\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bbf\u8c08\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u7eb3\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5982\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u3001\u50f5\u5c38\u95ee\u9898\u7b4914\u7c7b\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u6587\u732e\u63d0\u53ca\u7684\u5f02\u5473\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0d\u666e\u904d\u6216\u4e0d\u6784\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "ITS\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u5f02\u5473\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u9636\u6bb5\u7b49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002"}}
