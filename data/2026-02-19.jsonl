Service operators face a fundamental tension: enforcing Sybil resistance (one-person-one-account) while preserving user privacy, yet keeping on-chain verification cost and admission latency predictable at scale. Existing credential-based ZK admission approaches typically require per-request on-chain verification, making the provisioning cost grow with the number of concurrent joiners. We present \\textbf{ZK-AMS}, a scalable admission and provisioning layer that bridges real-world \\emph{Personhood Credentials} to anonymous on-chain service accounts. ZK-AMS combines (i) zero-knowledge credential validation, (ii) a \\emph{permissionless} batch submitter model, and (iii) a decentralized, privacy-preserving folding pipeline that uses Nova-style recursive aggregation together with multi-key homomorphic encryption, enabling batch settlement with \\emph{constant} on-chain verification per batch. We implement ZK-AMS end-to-end on an Ethereum testbed and evaluate admission throughput, end-to-end latency, and gas consumption.

The AADM challenge was the second competition in which an autonomous UAV acted as a data mule, where the UAV downloaded data from multiple base stations (BSs) in a dynamic wireless environment. Participating teams designed flight control and decision-making algorithms for choosing which BSs to communicate with and how to plan flight trajectories to maximize data download within a mission completion time. The competition was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 involved development and experimentation using a digital twin (DT) environment, and in Stage 2, the final test run was conducted on the outdoor testbed. The total score for each team was compiled from both stages. The resulting dataset includes link quality and data download measurements, both in DT and physical environments. Along with the USRP measurements used in the contest, the dataset also includes UAV telemetry, Keysight RF sensors position estimates, link quality measurements from LoRa receivers, and Fortem radar measurements.

To achieve this, MEC-based intelligent resource allocation for virtual reality users needs to be supported by coordination across MEC servers to harness distributed data. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution, and can be combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to develop generalized policies across MEC-servers. However, conventional FL incurs transmitting the full model parameters across the MEC-servers and the cloud, and suffer performance degradation due to naive global aggregation, especially in heterogeneous multi-radio access technology environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Federated Split Decision Transformer (FSDT), an offline RL framework where the transformer model is partitioned between MEC servers and the cloud. Agent-specific components (e.g., MEC-based embedding and prediction layers) enable local adaptability, while shared global layers in the cloud facilitate cooperative training across MEC servers. Experimental results demonstrate that FSDT enhances QoE for up to 10% in heterogeneous environments compared to baselines, while offloadingnearly 98% of the transformer model parameters to the cloud, thereby reducing the computational burden on MEC servers."}

To mitigate the coverage limitations of fixed terrestrial macro base stations (MBS) under non line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, fleets of unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) can be deployed as aerial base stations, dynamically repositioning to track vehicular users and traffic hotspots in coordination with the terrestrial network. This paper addresses cooperative multi-agent trajectory design under different service areas and takeoff configurations, where rapid and safe adaptation across scenarios is essential. We formulate the problem as a multi-task decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and solve it using centralized training and decentralized execution with double dueling deep Q-network (3DQN), enabling online training for real-world deployments. However, efficient exploration remains a bottleneck, with conventional strategies like $ε$-greedy requiring careful tuning. To overcome this, we propose the multi-agent meta-advisor with advisor override (MAMO). This framework guides agent exploration through a meta-policy learned jointly across tasks. It uses a dynamic override mechanism that allows agents to reject misaligned guidance when the advisor fails to generalize to a specific scenario. Simulation results across three realistic urban scenarios and multiple takeoff configurations show that MAMO achieves faster convergence and higher returns than tuned $ε$-greedy baselines, outperforming both an advisor-only ablation and a single generalized policy. Finally, we demonstrate that the learned UABS fleet significantly improves network performance compared to deployments without aerial support."}

In this paper, we propose two novel techniques that use Distributed Clock (DC) and Distributed Epoch (DE) recording schemes to eliminate excessive thread synchronization for OpenMP record and replay. Our evaluation on representative HPC applications with ReOMP, which we used to realize DC and DE recording, shows that our approach is 2-5x more efficient than traditional approaches that synchronize on every shared-memory access.

To retain its energy efficiency, analog PUM architectures augment memory arrays with CMOS-based domain-specific fixed-function hardware to provide complete kernel functionality, but the difficulty of integrating such specialized CMOS logic with memory arrays has largely limited analog PUM to being an accelerator for machine learning inference, or for closely related kernels. An opportunity exists to harness analog PUM for general-purpose computation: recent works have shown that memory arrays can also perform Boolean PUM operations, albeit with very different supporting hardware and electrical signals than analog PUM.\n  We propose DARTH-PUM, a general-purpose hybrid PUM architecture that tackles key hardware and software challenges to integrating analog PUM and digital PUM. We propose optimized peripheral circuitry, coordinating hardware to manage and interface between both types of PUM, an easy-to-use programming interface, and low-cost support for flexible data widths.

We introduce ReLoop, addressing silent failures from two complementary directions. Structured generation decomposes code production into a four-stage reasoning chain (understand, formalize, synthesize, verify) that mirrors expert modeling practice, with explicit variable-type reasoning and self-verification to prevent formulation errors at their source. Behavioral verification detects errors that survive generation by testing whether the formulation responds correctly to solver-based parameter perturbation, without requiring ground truth -- an external semantic signal that bypasses the self-consistency problem inherent in LLM-based code review. The two mechanisms are complementary: structured generation dominates on complex compositional problems, while behavioral verification becomes the largest single contributor on problems with localized formulation defects. Together with execution recovery via IIS-enhanced diagnostics, ReLoop raises correctness from 22.6% to 31.1% and execution from 72.1% to 100.0% on the strongest model, with consistent gains across five models spanning three paradigms (foundation, SFT, RL) and three benchmarks.

Specifically, we inspect every single element within a variable for checkpointing with an AD tool to determine whether the element has an impact on the application output or not.

Concurrently, recent advances in LLMs have enabled strong performance on software engineering benchmarks, particularly when paired with agentic workflows. In this work, we systematically evaluate whether current LLMs can reliably perform long-context code debugging and patch generation. Using SWE-bench Verified as a controlled experimental setting, we first evaluate state-of-the-art models within an agentic harness (mini-SWE-agent), where performance improves substantially: GPT-5-nano achieves up to a 31\\% resolve rate on 100 samples, and open-source models such as Deepseek-R1-0528 obtain competitive results. However, token-level analysis shows that successful agentic trajectories typically remain under 20k tokens, and that longer accumulated contexts correlate with lower success rates, indicating that agentic success primarily arises from task decomposition into short-context steps rather than effective long-context reasoning. To directly test long-context capability, we construct a data pipeline where we artificially inflate the context length of the input by placing the relevant files into the context (ensuring perfect retrieval recall); we then study single-shot patch generation under genuinely long contexts (64k-128k tokens). Despite this setup, performance degrades sharply: Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B achieves only a 7\\% resolve rate at 64k context, while GPT-5-nano solves none of the tasks. Qualitative analysis reveals systematic failure modes, including hallucinated diffs, incorrect file targets, and malformed patch headers.

However, LLM inference workloads are highly diverse, and modern GPU clusters are inherently heterogeneous, making it necessary to dynamically adjust deployment configurations online to better adapt to the elastic and dynamic nature of serverless environments. At the same time, enabling such online reconfiguration is particularly challenging due to the stateful nature of LLM inference and the massive size of model parameters. In this paper, we propose a dynamic pipeline reconfiguration approach that enables online adjustment of pipeline configurations while minimizing service downtime and performance degradation. Our method allows the system to select the optimal pipeline configuration in response to changing workloads. Experimental results on heterogeneous GPU platforms, including NVIDIA A100 and L40s, demonstrate that our migration mechanism incurs less than 50 ms of service downtime, while introducing under 10% overhead on both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT)."}

This ecosystem is characterized by short-term, often one-off, transactions between parties that have no prior familiarity. To establish trust among users, platforms employ rating systems which allow users to report on the quality of their previous interactions. However, while arguably crucial for these platforms to function, rating systems can perpetuate negative biases against marginalised groups. This paper investigates how to design platforms around biased reputation systems, reducing discrimination while maintaining incentives for all service providers to offer high quality service for users. We introduce an evolutionary game theoretical model to study how digital platforms can perpetuate or counteract rating-based discrimination. We focus on the platforms' decisions to promote service providers who have high reputations or who belong to a specific protected group. Our results demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between user experience and fairness: promoting highly-rated providers benefits users, but lowers the demand for marginalised providers against which the ratings are biased. Our results also provide evidence that intervening by tuning the demographics of the search results is a highly effective way of reducing unfairness while minimally impacting users. Furthermore, we show that even when precise measurements on the level of rating bias affecting marginalised service providers is unavailable, there is still potential to improve upon a recommender system which ignores protected characteristics. Altogether, our model highlights the benefits of proactive anti-discrimination design in systems where ratings are used to promote cooperative behaviour."}

Most of these models rely on correlational split criteria, such as variance reduction or information gain, which identify statistical associations but cannot imply causation between X and Y. Recent empirical studies in software engineering show that both correlational models and causal discovery algorithms suffer from pronounced instability. This instability arises from two complementary issues: 1-Correlation-based methods conflate association with causation. 2-Causal discovery algorithms rely on heuristic approximations to cope with the NP-hard nature of structure learning, causing their inferred graphs to vary widely under minor input perturbations. Together, these issues undermine trust, reproducibility, and the reliability of explanations in real-world SE tasks. Objective: This study investigates whether incorporating causality-aware split criteria into symbolic models can improve their stability and robustness, and whether such gains come at the cost of predictive or optimization performance. We additionally examine how the stability of human expert judgments compares to that of automated models. Method: Using 120+ multi-objective optimization tasks from the MOOT repository of multi-objective optimization tasks, we evaluate stability through a preregistered bootstrap-ensemble protocol that measures variance with win-score assignments. We compare the stability of human causal assessments with correlation-based decision trees (EZR). We would also compare the causality-aware trees, which leverage conditional-entropy split criteria and confounder filtering.

In complete interaction graphs, optimal space-time trade-offs are known for the leader election and exact majority problems. However, it has remained open if other graph families exhibit similar space-time complexity trade-offs, as existing lower bound techniques do not extend beyond highly dense graphs.\n  In this work, we show that -- unlike in complete graphs -- population protocols on bounded-degree trees do not exhibit significant asymptotic space-time trade-offs for leader election and exact majority. For these problems, we give constant-space protocols that have near-optimal worst-case expected stabilisation time. These new protocols achieve a linear speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art.\n  Our results are based on two novel protocols, which we believe are of independent interest. First, we give a new fast self-stabilising 2-hop colouring protocol for general interaction graphs, whose stabilisation time we bound using a stochastic drift argument. Second, we give a self-stabilising tree orientation algorithm that builds a rooted tree in optimal time on any tree. As a consequence, we can use simple constant-state protocols designed for directed trees to solve leader election and exact majority fast. For example, we show that ``directed'' annihilation dynamics solve exact majority in $O(n^2 \\log n)$ steps on directed trees."}

However, direct one-shot translation often fails to preserve program intent, leading to errors in control flow, type handling, and I/O behavior. We propose an algorithm-based pipeline that introduces a language-neutral intermediate specification to capture these details before code generation. This study empirically evaluates the extent to which structured planning can improve translation accuracy and reliability relative to direct translation. We conduct an automated paired experiment - direct and algorithm-based to translate between Python and Java using five widely used LLMs on the Avatar and CodeNet datasets. For each combination (model, dataset, approach, and direction), we compile and execute the translated program and run the tests provided. We record compilation results, runtime behavior, timeouts (e.g., infinite loop), and test outcomes. We compute accuracy from these tests, counting a translation as correct only if it compiles, runs without exceptions or timeouts, and passes all tests. We then map every failed compile-time and runtime case to a unified, language-aware taxonomy and compare subtype frequencies between the direct and algorithm-based approaches. Overall, the Algorithm-based approach increases micro-average accuracy from 67.7% to 78.5% (10.8% increase). It eliminates lexical and token errors by 100%, reduces incomplete constructs by 72.7%, and structural and declaration issues by 61.1%. It also substantially lowers runtime dependency and entry-point failures by 78.4%. These results demonstrate that algorithm-based pipelines enable more reliable, intent-preserving code translation, providing a foundation for robust multilingual programming assistants."}

Toosi", "Rajkumar Buyya"], "title": "DistributedEstimator: Distributed Training of Quantum Neural Networks via Circuit Cutting", "comment": null, "summary": "Circuit cutting decomposes a large quantum circuit into a collection of smaller subcircuits. The outputs of these subcircuits are then classically reconstructed to recover the original expectation values. While prior work characterises cutting overhead largely in terms of subcircuit counts and sampling complexity, its end-to-end impact on iterative, estimator-driven training pipelines remains insufficiently measured from a systems perspective. In this paper, we propose a cut-aware estimator execution pipeline that treats circuit cutting as a staged distributed workload and instruments each estimator query into partitioning, subexperiment generation, parallel execution, and classical reconstruction phases. Using logged runtime traces and learning outcomes on two binary classification workloads (Iris and MNIST), we quantify cutting overheads, scaling limits, and sensitivity to injected stragglers, and we evaluate whether accuracy and robustness are preserved under matched training budgets. Our measurements show that cutting introduces substantial end-to-end overheads that grow with the number of cuts, and that reconstruction constitutes a dominant fraction of per-query time, bounding achievable speed-up under increased parallelism. Despite these systems costs, test accuracy and robustness are preserved in the measured regimes, with configuration-dependent improvements observed in some cut settings. These results indicate that practical scaling of circuit cutting for learning workloads hinges on reducing and overlapping reconstruction and on scheduling policies that account for barrier-dominated critical paths."}

Software is becoming increasingly important, not only in general but specifically in relation to manufacturing, especially with regard to digital manufacturing and a shift towards the usage of artificial intelligence. This increases the need not only to model software, but also to integrate services directly into the AAS. The existing literature contains individual solutions to implement such software-heavy AAS. However, there is no systematic analysis of software architectures that integrate software services directly into the AAS. This paper aims to fill this research gap and differentiate architectures based on software quality criteria as well as typical manufacturing use cases. This work may be considered as an interpretation guideline for software-heavy AAS, both in academia and for practitioners."}

For ZK-rollups, delayed proofs cause finality lag and economic loss; for Ethereum's emerging L1 zkEVM, proofs must complete within the 12-second slot window to enable stateless validation. The Ethereum Foundation's Ethproofs initiative coordinates multiple independent zkVMs across proving clusters to achieve real-time block proving, yet no principled orchestration framework addresses the joint challenges of (i) strict head-of-chain ordering, (ii) sub-slot latency bounds, (iii) fault-tolerant task reassignment, and (iv) prover-agnostic workflow composition. We present push0, a cloud-native proof orchestration system that decouples prover binaries from scheduling infrastructure. push0 employs an event-driven dispatcher--collector architecture over persistent priority queues, enforcing block-sequential proving while exploiting intra-block parallelism. We formalize requirements drawn from production ZK-rollup operations and the Ethereum real-time proving specification, then demonstrate via production Kubernetes cluster experiments that push0 achieves 5 ms median orchestration overhead with 99--100% scaling efficiency at 32 dispatchers for realistic workloads--overhead negligible (less than 0.1%) relative to typical proof computation times of 7+ seconds. Controlled Docker experiments validate these results, showing comparable performance (3--10 ms P50) when network variance is eliminated. Production deployment on the Zircuit zkrollup (14+ million mainnet blocks since March 2025) provides ecological validity for these controlled experiments. Our design enables seamless integration of heterogeneous zkVMs, supports automatic task recovery via message persistence, and provides the scheduling primitives necessary for both centralized rollup operators and decentralized multi-prover networks."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities, direct intent-to-code synthesis frequently suffers from the leap-to-code failure mode, where models prematurely emit code without grounding in program structure, constraints, and semantics. This will result in non-compilable tests, hallucinated function signatures, low branch coverage, and semantically irrelevant assertions that cannot properly capture bugs. We introduce SPARC, a neuro-symbolic, scenario-based framework that bridges this gap through four stages: (1) Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis, (2) an Operation Map that grounds LLM reasoning in validated utility helpers, (3) Path-targeted test synthesis, and (4) an iterative, self-correction validation loop using compiler and runtime feedback. We evaluate SPARC on 59 real-world and algorithmic subjects, where it outperforms the vanilla prompt generation baseline by 31.36% in line coverage, 26.01% in branch coverage, and 20.78% in mutation score, matching or exceeding the symbolic execution tool KLEE on complex subjects. SPARC retains 94.3% of tests through iterative repair and produces code with significantly higher developer-rated readability and maintainability. By aligning LLM reasoning with program structure, SPARC provides a scalable path for industrial-grade testing of legacy C codebases."}

One of the algorithms for generating nodes suitable for meshless numerical analysis is an n-dimensional Poisson disc sampling based method. It can handle complex geometries and supports variable node density, a crucial feature for adaptive analysis. We modify this method for parallel execution using coupled spatial indexing and work distribution hypertrees. The latter is prebuilt according to the node density function, ensuring that each leaf represents a balanced work unit. Threads advance separate fronts and claim work hypertree leaves as needed while avoiding leaves neighbouring those claimed by other threads. Node placement constraints and the partially prebuilt spatial hypertree are combined to eliminate the need to lock the tree while it is being modified. Thread collision handling is managed by the work hypertree at the leaf level, drastically reducing the number of required mutex acquisitions for point insertion collision checks. We explore the behaviour of the proposed algorithm and compare the performance with existing attempts at parallelisation and consider the requirements for adapting the developed algorithm to distributed systems."}

This exacerbates head-of-line (HoL) blocking during the compute-intensive prefill phase, where long-running requests monopolize resources and delay higher-priority ones, leading to widespread time-to-first-token (TTFT) SLO violations. While chunked prefill enables interruptibility, it introduces an inherent trade-off between responsiveness and throughput: reducing chunk size improves response latency but degrades computational efficiency, whereas increasing chunk size maximizes throughput but exacerbates blocking. This necessitates an adaptive preemption mechanism. However, dynamically balancing execution granularity against scheduling overheads remains a key challenge.\n  In this paper, we propose FlowPrefill, a TTFT-goodput-optimized serving system that resolves this conflict by decoupling preemption granularity from scheduling frequency. To achieve adaptive prefill scheduling, FlowPrefill introduces two key innovations: 1) Operator-Level Preemption, which leverages operator boundaries to enable fine-grained execution interruption without the efficiency loss associated with fixed small chunking; and 2) Event-Driven Scheduling, which triggers scheduling decisions only upon request arrival or completion events, thereby supporting efficient preemption responsiveness while minimizing control-plane overhead. Evaluation on real-world production traces shows that FlowPrefill improves maximum goodput by up to 5.6$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art systems while satisfying heterogeneous SLOs."}
