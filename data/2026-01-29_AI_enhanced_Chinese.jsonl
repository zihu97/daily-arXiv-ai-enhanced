However, existing bit-truncation memories require custom designs for a specific application. In this paper, we present a novel bit-truncation memory with full adaptation flexibility, which can truncate any number of data bits at run time to meet different quality and power trade-off requirements for various approximate applications. The developed bit-truncation memory has been applied to two representative data-intensive approximate applications: video processing and deep learning. Our experiments show that the proposed memory can support three different video applications (including luminance-aware, content-aware, and region-of-interest-aware) with enhanced power efficiency (up to 47.02% power savings) as compared to state-of-the-art. In addition, the proposed memory achieves significant (up to 51.69%) power savings for both baseline and pruned lightweight deep learning models, respectively, with a low implementation cost (2.89% silicon area overhead).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5168\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f4d\u622a\u65ad\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u622a\u65ad\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u636e\u4f4d\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u7c7b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8d28\u91cf-\u529f\u8017\u6743\u8861\u9700\u6c42", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f39\u6027\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4efb\u610f\u4f4d\u6570\u622a\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\uff08\u4eae\u5ea6/\u5185\u5bb9/\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\uff09\u53ca\u8f7b\u91cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u89c6\u9891\u5e94\u7528\u8282\u80fd\u6700\u9ad847.02%\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf/\u88c1\u526a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8282\u80fd\u8fbe51.69%\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a02.89%\u82af\u7247\u9762\u79ef\u5f00\u9500", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u80fd\u5b58\u50a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Uneven wear of memory is a major barrier. The problem is becoming even more urgent as emerging memory such as phase-change memory is subject to even shorter lifespan. Various solutions have been proposed, but they either require complicated hardware extensions or apply only to certain program constructs such as loops. This research proposes a new method, dual-ring wear leveling. It takes inspiration from the natural law known as the ``golden ratio\" and how it helps flower petals evenly receive sun lights. By modeling memory as two rings and combines the idea with existing memory management, garbage collection, the new solution offers an effective way to reduce memory wear and hence lengthen memory lifespan.

Conventional static resource allocation often leads to overprovisioning or underprovisioning due to the dynamic nature of traffic loads and application demands. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid forecast-driven Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines predictive intelligence with SFC provisioning. Specifically, we leverage DRL to generate datasets capturing DC resource utilization and service demands, which are then used to train deep learning forecasting models. Using Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization, the best-performing models, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, Temporal Graph Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory, are combined into an ensemble to enhance stability and accuracy. The ensemble predictions are integrated into the DC selection process, enabling proactive placement decisions that consider both current and future resource availability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only sustains high acceptance ratios for resource-intensive services such as Cloud Gaming and VoIP but also significantly improves acceptance ratios for latency-critical categories such as Augmented Reality increases from 30% to 50%, while Industry 4.0 improves from 30% to 45%. Consequently, the prediction-based model achieves significantly lower E2E latencies of 20.5%, 23.8%, and 34.8% reductions for VoIP, Video Streaming, and Cloud Gaming, respectively. This strategy ensures more balanced resource allocation, and reduces contention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u6848\u6df7\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8DRL\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3VNF\u653e\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8d44\u6e90\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u56e0\u6d41\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u8f7d\u6216\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u5584SFC\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u548cQoS", "method": "\u91c7\u7528DRL\u751f\u6210\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b(ST-GNN, T-GNN, LSTM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Opt UAE\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u7ec4\u6210\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u987e\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u8d44\u6e90", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1aCloud Gaming\u548cVoIP\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\uff1b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u670d\u52a1\u5982AR\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u4ece30%\u5347\u81f350%, Industry 4.0\u4ece30%\u523045%\uff1bE2E\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\uff1aVoIP\u51cf20.5%\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u51cf23.8%\u3001Cloud Gaming\u51cf34.8%", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5747\u8861\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e89\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf"}}

Error-bounded lossy compression has emerged as a critical solution for mitigating these challenges, providing a means to reduce data size while ensuring that reconstructed data remains valid for scientific analysis. In this paper, we present a data-driven scientific data compressor, called Discontinuous Data-informed Local Subspaces (Discontinuous DLS), to improve compression-to-error ratios over data-agnostic compressors. This error-bounded compressor leverages localized spatial and temporal subspaces, informed by the underlying data structure, to enhance compression efficiency and preserve key features. The presented technique is flexible and applicable to a wide range of scientific data, including fluid dynamics, environmental simulations, and other high-dimensional, time-dependent datasets. We describe the core principles of the method and demonstrate its ability to significantly reduce storage requirements without compromising critical data fidelity. The technique is implemented in a distributed computing environment using MPI, and its performance is evaluated against state-of-the-art error-bounded compression methods in terms of compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

We introduce IBR-GCS, an Iterative Best Response (IBR) planning approach based on the Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) framework that models highway driving as a generalized noncooperative game. IBR-GCS integrates combinatorial maneuver reasoning, trajectory planning, and game-theoretic interaction within a unified framework. The key novelty is a vehicle-specific, strategy-dependent GCS construction. Specifically, at each best-response update, each vehicle builds its own graph conditioned on the current strategies of the other vehicles, with vertices representing lane-specific, time-varying, convex, collision-free regions and edges encoding dynamically feasible transitions. This yields a shortest-path problem in GCS for each best-response step, which admits an efficient convex relaxation that can be solved using convex optimization tools without exhaustive discrete tree search. We then apply an iterative best-response scheme in which vehicles update their trajectories sequentially and provide conditions under which the resulting inexact updates converge to an approximate generalized Nash equilibrium.

This is way more promising for scalability and integration density than the default option of improving the fidelity of the analog neural network at the cost of significant energy, area, and design overhead, through extensive calibration and conservative analog design.\n  We first present a physics-informed hardware-aware model for a time-domain vector-matrix multiplier implemented with single-transistor floating-gate memory cells that explicitly accounts for two dominant non-idealities of the physical implementation - capacitive crosstalk and bit-line voltage drop - and integrates seamlessly with modern deep-learning workflows. The model discretizes each operation into adaptive time slots, processes activation patterns in parallel, and accumulates their contributions to predict effective multiplier outputs. Using measurements from a 16x16 silicon array, we calibrate the model, show that crosstalk is layout-dependent and often dominant, and introduce an improved weight-extraction procedure that doubles signal-to-error ratio versus an ideal vector-matrix multiplier model. Finally, we show that by training silicon-based analog neural networks using an hardware-aware model in the forward pass we can recover the accuracy of the ideal software networks across three architectures -- custom MLP on low-resolution MNIST, LeNet-5 on MNIST, and a VGG-style CNN on CIFAR-10 - establishing a complete design-to-deployment workflow for time-domain analog neuromorphic chips.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Based on these results, we introduce and implement two algorithms: one for drawing sub-perfect samples (SPS) of the system's workload and the second one to estimate the system's stability condition given the statistics of the jobs' input stream. The SPS algorithm allows for a massive GPU parallelization, greatly improving the efficiency of performance metrics evaluation.

As demand for higher-resolution images and longer videos increases, single-GPU inference becomes inefficient due to increased latency and large activation sizes. Current frameworks employ sequence parallelism (SP) techniques such as Ulysses Attention and Ring Attention to scale inference. However, these implementations have three primary limitations: (1) suboptimal communication patterns for network topologies on modern GPU machines, (2) latency bottlenecks from all-to-all operations in inter-machine communication, and (3) GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads from using two-sided communication libraries. To address these issues, we present StreamFusion, a topology-aware efficient DiT serving engine. StreamFusion incorporates three key innovations: (1) a topology-aware sequence parallelism technique that accounts for inter- and intra-machine bandwidth differences, (2) Torus Attention, a novel SP technique enabling overlapping of inter-machine all-to-all operations with computation, and (3) a one-sided communication implementation that minimizes GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads.

As LLMs increasingly serve as evaluators in code-based RL, their ability to detect reward hacking remains understudied. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of reward exploits spanning across 54 categories and introduce TRACE (Testing Reward Anomalies in Code Environments), a synthetically curated and human-verified benchmark containing 517 testing trajectories. Unlike prior work that evaluates reward hack detection in isolated classification scenarios, we contrast these evaluations with a more realistic, contrastive anomaly detection setup on TRACE. Our experiments reveal that models capture reward hacks more effectively in contrastive settings than in isolated classification settings, with GPT-5.2 with highest reasoning mode achieving the best detection rate at 63%, up from 45% in isolated settings on TRACE. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art models struggle significantly more with semantically contextualized reward hacks compared to syntactically contextualized ones. We further conduct qualitative analyses of model behaviors, as well as ablation studies showing that the ratio of benign to hacked trajectories and analysis cluster sizes substantially impact detection performance.

The interactions within these systems often lead to extreme events whose origins remain obscured by the black box of emergence. Interpreting these events is critical for system safety. This paper proposes the first framework for explaining emergent extreme events in multi-agent systems, aiming to answer three fundamental questions: When does the event originate? Who drives it? And what behaviors contribute to it? Specifically, we adapt the Shapley value to faithfully attribute the occurrence of extreme events to each action taken by agents at different time steps, i.e., assigning an attribution score to the action to measure its influence on the event. We then aggregate the attribution scores along the dimensions of time, agent, and behavior to quantify the risk contribution of each dimension. Finally, we design a set of metrics based on these contribution scores to characterize the features of extreme events. Experiments across diverse multi-agent system scenarios (economic, financial, and social) demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide general insights into the emergence of extreme phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Shapley\u503cAnyway\u5f52\u56e0\u884c\u52a8\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "iscono\u7406\u89e3\u6d8c\u73b0\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e38\u56e0\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5f0f\u6d8c\u73b0\u800c\u88ab\u906e\u853d\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u7f16Shapley\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6570\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u805a\u5408\u5206\u6570\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u91ca\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5206\u6790\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Prior research shows that the adoption and use of AI-powered tools differ between core and peripheral developers. However, it remains unclear how this dynamic unfolds in the emerging era of autonomous coding agents. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of 9,427 agentic PRs, examining how core and peripheral developers use, review, modify, and verify agent-generated contributions prior to acceptance. Through a mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis, we make four key contributions. First, a subset of peripheral developers use agents more often, delegating tasks evenly across bug fixing, feature addition, documentation, and testing. In contrast, core developers focus more on documentation and testing, yet their agentic PRs are frequently merged into the main/master branch. Second, core developers engage slightly more in review discussions than peripheral developers, and both groups focus on evolvability issues. Third, agentic PRs are less likely to be modified, but when they are, both groups commonly perform refactoring. Finally, peripheral developers are more likely to merge without running CI checks, whereas core developers more consistently require passing verification before acceptance.

In this paper, a generic model, Agentic Fog (AF), is presented, in which fog nodes are represented as policy-driven autonomous agents that communicate via p2p interactions based on shared memory and localized coordination. The suggested architecture decomposes a system's goals into abstract policy guidance and formalizes decentralized fog coordination as an exact potential game. The framework is guaranteed to converge and remain stable under asynchronous updates, bounded-rational best-response dynamics, and node failures. Simulations demonstrate that the AF system achieves lower average latency and adapts more efficiently to varying demand than greedy heuristics and integer linear programming under dynamic conditions.

At the architecture and device levels, we design a 2.5D PIM stack integrating two phase-change memory compute dies, a logic die, and high-bandwidth scratchpad memory within a unified advanced package. An external non-volatile storage stack stores large APSP results persistently. The design achieves both tile-level and unit-level parallel processing to sustain high throughput.

The method first constructs system state representations from high-dimensional metric sequences, applies nonlinear transformations to extract cross-dimensional dynamic features, and integrates multiple source information such as resource utilization, scheduling behavior, and task load variations within a shared representation space. It then introduces a graph-based modeling mechanism to capture latent dependencies among metrics, allowing the model to learn competitive propagation patterns and structural interference across resource links. On this basis, task-specific mapping structures are designed to model the differences among contention types and enhance the classifier's ability to distinguish multiple contention patterns. To achieve stable performance, the method employs an adaptive multi-task loss weighting strategy that balances shared feature learning with task-specific feature extraction and generates final contention predictions through a standardized inference process. Experiments conducted on a public system trace dataset demonstrate advantages in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1, and sensitivity analyses on batch size, training sample scale, and metric dimensionality further confirm the model's stability and applicability.

To address this gap, we analyze 1,210 merged agent-generated bug-fix PRs from Python repositories in the AIDev dataset. Using SonarQube, we perform a differential analysis between base and merged commits to identify code quality issues newly introduced by PR changes. We examine issue frequency, density, severity, and rule-level prevalence across five agents.

Given a local Triton kernel and a chunk schedule, AutoOverlap performs transformations to align computation with chunk availability. Implemented as a source-to-source compiler on Triton, AutoOverlap delivers an average end-to-end speedup of 1.3$\\times$ and up to 4.7$\\times$ on multi-GPU workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faAutoOverlap\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u878d\u5408\u5185\u6838\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u901a\u4fe1\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21GPU\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6d41\u7ea7\u91cd\u53e0\u5bfc\u81f4\u989d\u5916\u5185\u6838\u542f\u52a8\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u7ea7\u540c\u6b65\u53ca\u5c3e\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f2\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u534f\u8c03\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u901a\u4fe1\u5757\u62bd\u8c61\u89e3\u8026\u901a\u4fe1\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5185\u6838\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u79fb\u690d\u5757\u7ea7\u8ba1\u5212\u3001\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6216\u6a21\u677f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8bd1\u8f6c\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5757\u7ea7\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\u3002", "result": "\u5728Triton\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e90\u7801\u5230\u6e90\u7801\u7f16\u8bd1\uff0c\u591aGPU\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e73\u5747\u52a0\u901f1.3\u500d\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe4.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoOverlap\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fGPU\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Yet their growing volume and verbosity make both manual inspection and automated analysis increasingly costly, time-consuming, and environmentally costly. While prior work has explored log compression, anomaly detection, and LLM-based log analysis, most efforts target structured system logs rather than the unstructured, noisy, and verbose logs typical of CI workflows.\n  We present LogSieve, a lightweight, RCA-aware and semantics-preserving log reduction technique that filters low-information lines while retaining content relevant to downstream reasoning. Evaluated on CI logs from 20 open-source Android projects using GitHub Actions, LogSieve achieves an average 42% reduction in lines and 40% reduction in tokens with minimal semantic loss. This pre-inference reduction lowers computational cost and can proportionally reduce energy use (and associated emissions) by decreasing the volume of data processed during LLM inference.\n  Compared with structure-first baselines (LogZip and random-line removal), LogSieve preserves much higher semantic and categorical fidelity (Cosine = 0.93, GPTScore = 0.93, 80% exact-match accuracy). Embedding-based classifiers automate relevance detection with near-human accuracy (97%), enabling scalable and sustainable integration of semantics-aware filtering into CI workflows.

At the same time, advances in GPU technology driven by shrinking transistor sizes and lower operating voltages have made these devices increasingly susceptible to soft errors. While prior work has examined GPU reliability, most studies have focused on general-purpose applications or conventional neural networks mostly used for vision tasks such as classification and detection. In contrast, systematic analysis of modern large-scale LLMs remains limited, despite their rapid adoption in diverse application scenarios. Given the unique characteristics of LLMs, their resilience to soft errors may differ substantially from earlier models. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first instruction-level fault injection study of LLM inference. Our approach reveals reliability characteristics from multiple perspectives, highlighting the effects of model architecture, parameter scale, and task complexity.

However, sophisticated software supply chain security threats often stem from cascaded vulnerability and security weakness chains that span dependent components. Moreover, although the adoption of Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) has been accelerating, downstream vulnerability findings vary substantially across SBOM generators and analysis tools. We propose a novel approach to SBOM-driven security analysis methods and tools. We model vulnerability relationships over dependency structure rather than treating scanner outputs as independent records. We represent enriched SBOMs as heterogeneous graphs with nodes being the SBOM components and dependencies, the known software vulnerabilities, and the known software security weaknesses. We then train a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HGAT) to predict whether a component is associated with at least one known vulnerability. Since documented multi-vulnerability chains are scarce, we model cascade discovery as a link prediction problem over CVE pairs using a multi-layer perceptron neural network. This way, we produce ranked candidate links that can be composed into multi-step paths. The HGAT component classifier achieves an Accuracy of 91.03% and an F1-score of 74.02%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, if the complexity can be reduced, priority encoders can feasibly accelerate a variety of key applications, such as high-precision integer arithmetic and content-addressable memory. We propose a new paradigm for constructing priority encoders by generalizing the previously proposed two-level priority encoder structure. We extend this concept to three and four levels using two techniques -- cascading and composition -- and discuss further generalization. We then analyze the complexity and delay of new and existing priority encoder designs as a function of input length, for both FPGA and ASIC implementation technologies. In particular, we compare the multi-level structure to the traditional single-level priority encoder structure, a tree-based design, a recursive design, and the two-level structure. We find that the two-level architecture provides balanced performance -- reducing complexity by around half, but at the cost of a corresponding increase in delay. Additional levels have diminishing returns, highlighting a tradeoff between complexity and delay. Meanwhile, the tree and recursive designs are generally faster, but are more complex than the two-level and multi-level structures. We explore several characteristics and patterns of the designs across a wide range of input lengths. We then provide recommendations on which architecture to use for a given input length and implementation technology, based on which design factors -- such as complexity or delay -- are most important to the hardware designer. With this overview and analysis of various priority encoder architectures, we provide a priority encoder toolkit to assist hardware designers in creating the most optimal design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea7\u8054\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u4e24\u7ea7\u4f18\u5148\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e09\u5230\u56db\u7ea7\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728FPGA\u548cASIC\u4e0a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6bd4\u7279\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u5982512\u4f4d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\u4f18\u5148\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u6574\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u5bfb\u5740\u5b58\u50a8}\\)\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u786c\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5e7f\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u4e24\u7ea7\u4f18\u5148\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u4e09\u5230\u56db\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u6790FPGA\u548cASIC\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u968f\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5355\u7ea7\u3001\u6811\u72b6\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea650%\uff0c\u4f46\u5ef6\u8fdf\u76f8\u5e94\u589e\u52a0\uff1b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u522b\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf\u3002\u6811\u72b6\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6216\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u67b6\u6784\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, recent vulnerabilities in third-party packages have led to serious security breaches, compromising the integrity of applications that depend on them. Objective: This study investigates how npm package developers perceive and handle security in their work. We examined developers' understanding of security risks, the practices and tools they use, the barriers to stronger security measures, and their suggestions for improving the npm ecosystem's security. Method: We conducted an online survey with 75 npm package developers and undertook a mixed-methods approach to analyzing their responses. Results: While developers prioritize security, they perceive their packages as only moderately secure, with concerns about supply chain attacks, dependency vulnerabilities, and malicious code. Only 40% are satisfied with the current npm security tools due to issues such as alert fatigue. Automated methods such as two-factor authentication and npm audit are favored over code reviews. Many drop dependencies due to abandonment or vulnerabilities, and typically respond to vulnerabilities in their packages by quickly releasing patches. Key barriers include time constraints and high false-positive rates. To improve npm security, developers seek better detection tools, clearer documentation, stronger account protections, and more education initiatives.

As GPUs continue improving to satisfy ever-increasing performance demands, analyzing past and current progress becomes paramount in determining future constraints on scientific research. This is particularly compelling in the AI domain, where rapid technological advancements and fierce global competition have led the United States to recently implement export control regulations limiting international access to advanced AI chips. For this reason, this paper studies technical progress in NVIDIA datacenter GPUs released from the mid-2000s until today. Specifically, we compile a comprehensive dataset of datacenter NVIDIA GPUs comprising several features, ranging from computational performance to release price. Then, we examine trends in main GPU features and estimate progress indicators for per-memory bandwidth, per-dollar, and per-watt increase rates. Our main results identify doubling times of 1.44 and 1.69 years for FP16 and FP32 operations (without accounting for sparsity benefits), while FP64 doubling times range from 2.06 to 3.79 years. Off-chip memory size and bandwidth grew at slower rates than computing performance, doubling every 3.32 to 3.53 years. The release prices of datacenter GPUs have roughly doubled every 5.1 years, while their power consumption has approximately doubled every 16 years. Finally, we quantify the potential implications of current U.S. export control regulations in terms of the potential performance gaps that would result if implementation were assumed to be complete and successful. We find that recently proposed changes to export controls would shrink the potential performance gap from 23.6x to 3.54x.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u67902000\u5e74\u4ee3\u4e2d\u671f\u81f3\u4ecaNVIDIA\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3GPU\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6f14\u8fdb\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u500d\u589e\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f8e\u56fd\u51fa\u53e3\u7ba1\u5236\u5bf9AI\u82af\u7247\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76GPU\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bf9AI\u9886\u57df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b9e\u65bd\u9ad8\u7aefAI\u82af\u7247\u51fa\u53e3\u7ba1\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u5f80\u8fdb\u6b65\u53ef\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u79d1\u7814\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e", "method": "\u6784\u5efaNVIDIA\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3GPU\u7efc\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd/\u4ef7\u683c\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d8b\u52bf\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97FP\u8fd0\u7b97\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u4ef7\u683c\u53ca\u529f\u8017\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u7684\u500d\u589e\u65f6\u95f4", "result": "FP16/FP32\u8fd0\u7b97\u500d\u589e\u5468\u671f\u4e3a1.44-1.69\u5e74\uff1bFP64\u4e3a2.06-3.79\u5e74\uff1b\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\u6bcf3.32-3.53\u5e74\u7ffb\u500d\uff1b\u4ef7\u683c\u500d\u589e\u5468\u671f5.1\u5e74\uff0c\u529f\u801716\u5e74\uff1b\u51fa\u53e3\u7ba1\u5236\u5c06\u4f7f\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece23.6\u500d\u7f29\u5c0f\u81f33.54\u500d", "conclusion": "GPU\u7b97\u529b\u589e\u957f\u901f\u5ea6\u8fdc\u8d85\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u51fa\u53e3\u7ba1\u5236\u653f\u7b56\u5c06\u663e\u8457\u538b\u7f29\u56fd\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u5730\u7f18\u653f\u6cbb\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5f71\u54cd"}}

However, the quadratic scaling complexity of attention poses significant challenges for efficient hardware implementation. While techniques such as quantization and pruning help mitigate this issue, selective token attention offers a promising alternative by narrowing the attention scope to only the most relevant tokens, reducing computation and filtering out noise.\n  In this work, we propose SATA, a locality-centric dynamic scheduling scheme that proactively manages sparsely distributed access patterns from selective Query-Key operations. By reordering operand flow and exploiting data locality, our approach enables early fetch and retirement of intermediate Query/Key vectors, improving system utilization. We implement and evaluate our token management strategy in a control and compute system, using runtime traces from selective-attention-based models.

To facilitate their adoption by language designers, the comprehensibility of the language used to define other languages is an important aspect to evaluate. Moreover, considering that language workbenches are relatively new tools, user acceptance emerges as a crucial factor to be accounted for during their assessment. Current literature often neglects user-centred aspects like comprehensibility and acceptance in the assessment of this breed of tools. This paper addresses this gap through a family of experiments assessing Neverlang, a modular language workbench. The study adopts a tailored version of the Method Evaluation Model (MEM) to evaluate the comprehensibility of Neverlang's meta-language and programs, as well as user acceptance in terms of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. It also investigates the relationships among these dimensions. The experiments were conducted in three iterations involving participants from academia. The results reveal that users demonstrate sufficient comprehension of Neverlang's meta-language, particularly concerning its syntax, express a favourable perception of its usefulness, and indicate their intention to use it. However, the results also indicate that Neverlang's ease of use remains a challenge. Additionally, variations in the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, whether low or high, influence the users' intention to use the tool. Surprisingly, no significant correlation is found between comprehensibility and user acceptance. Notably, higher comprehensibility of the meta-language does not necessarily translate into greater acceptance, underscoring the complex interplay between comprehension and adoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0Neverlang\u7684\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\u5e76\u8ba4\u53ef\u5176\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u7528\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4e0e\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u65e0\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u5ffd\u7565\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4ee5\u7528\u6237\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u548c\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b(MEM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u8f6e\u5b66\u672f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u8bed\u6cd5\uff09\u7406\u89e3\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u8ba4\u53ef\u6709\u7528\u6027\u5e76\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u5411\uff1b\u4f46\u6613\u7528\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u7528\u6027/\u6709\u7528\u6027\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\uff1b\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\u91c7\u7eb3\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1a\u6613\u7528\u6027\u662f\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u9ad8\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u91c7\u7eb3\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Furthermore, VGGT presents hardware challenges regarding precision-sensitive nonlinear operators and memory-intensive global attention. To address this, we propose VersaQ-3D, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework. Algorithmically, we introduce the first calibration-free, scene-agnostic quantization for VGGT down to 4-bit, leveraging orthogonal transforms to decorrelate features and suppress outliers. Architecturally, we design a reconfigurable accelerator supporting BF16, INT8, and INT4. A unified systolic datapath handles both linear and nonlinear operators, reducing latency by 60%, while two-stage recomputation-based tiling alleviates memory pressure for long-sequence attention. Evaluations show VersaQ-3D preserves 98-99% accuracy at W4A8. At W4A4, it outperforms prior methods by 1.61x-2.39x across diverse scenes.

Profiling on modern GPUs reveals that sampling can account for up to 70% of total model inference latency-primarily due to substantial memory loads and writes from vocabulary-wide logits, reduction-based token selection, and iterative masked updates. These processes demand large on-chip SRAM and involve irregular memory accesses that conventional NPUs struggle to handle efficiently. To address this, we identify a set of critical instructions that an NPU architecture must specifically optimize for dLLM sampling.

However, large codebases can make this reporting challenging. This paper employs an empirical approach to understand developers' experience with Google Play Store's Data Safety Section (DSS) form.\n  We first survey 41 Android developers to understand how they categorize privacy-related data into DSS categories and how confident they feel when completing the DSS form. To gain a broader and more detailed view of the challenges developers encounter during the process, we complement the survey with an analysis of 172 online developer discussions, capturing the perspectives of 642 additional developers. Together, these two data sources represent insights from 683 developers.\n  Our findings reveal that developers often manually classify the privacy-related data their apps collect into the data categories defined by Google-or, in some cases, omit classification entirely-and rely heavily on existing online resources when completing the form. Moreover, developers are generally confident in recognizing the data their apps collect, yet they lack confidence in translating this knowledge into DSS-compliant disclosures. Key challenges include issues in identifying privacy-relevant data to complete the form, limited understanding of the form, and concerns about app rejection due to discrepancies with Google's privacy requirements.\n  These results underscore the need for clearer guidance and more accessible tooling to support developers in meeting privacy-aware reporting obligations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76Android\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u586b\u62a5Google Play\u6570\u636e\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u5355\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5206\u7c7b\u56f0\u96be\u4e0e\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u6307\u5357\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8981\u6c42Android\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u51c6\u786e\u62a5\u544a\u5e94\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u5927\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u56f0\u96be\u5927\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728Google Play Data Safety Section\u8868\u5355\u586b\u62a5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8c03\u67e541\u540dAndroid\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e0e\u5206\u6790172\u4e2a\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba8\u8bba\uff08\u542b642\u540d\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\uff09\uff0c\u603b\u8986\u76d6683\u540d\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e38\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u6216\u7701\u7565\u9690\u79c1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5728\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\uff1b\u867d\u6709\u4fe1\u5fc3\u8bc6\u522b\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8f6c\u5411\u5408\u89c4\u62ab\u9732\u65f6\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u5305\u62ec\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u79c1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8868\u5355\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u987e\u8651\u5e94\u7528\u88ab\u62d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u547c\u5401\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0e\u6613\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u62a5\u544a\u4e49\u52a1\u3002"}}

By strategically poisoning retrieval contexts through a mutation-based approach, DrainCode forces LLMs to produce significantly longer outputs, thereby increasing GPU latency and energy consumption. We evaluate the effectiveness of DrainCode across multiple models. Our experiments show that DrainCode achieves up to an 85% increase in latency, a 49% increase in energy consumption, and more than a 3x increase in output length compared to the baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of the attack across different prompting strategies and its effectiveness compared to different defenses.

Lila enables distributed reporting of build results and aggregation into a reproducibility database, benefiting both practitioners and future empirical build reproducibility studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6784\u5efa\u4ea7\u7269\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u76d1\u63a7\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Lila\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "mot-houseivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5206\u53d1\u6e20\u9053\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6784\u5efa\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9ad8\u91cd\u73b0\u7387\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u76d1\u63a7\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u9ad8\u91cd\u73b0\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe\u523090%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f46\u76d1\u63a7\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Lila\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u529f\u80fd\u5305\u7ba1\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3002 remediation: :\u6587\u5b57\u5217\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3053\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u8a18\u8f09\u305b\u3088\u3002", "result": "Lila\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u548c\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6d41\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6539\u5584\u76d1\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Lila\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5206\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable"}}

Unlike general-purpose engines such as ONNX Runtime, today's LLM inference systems offer little operator-level visibility, leaving developers blind to where time and resources go. Even basic questions -- is this workload memory-bound or compute-bound? -- often remain unanswered. To close this gap, we develop a fine-grained, non-intrusive profiling framework for modern LLM inference engines, exemplified by llama.cpp but applicable to similar runtime architectures. Built on extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology, our system dynamically attaches probes to runtime functions across multiple layers -- without modifying or recompiling the source. It transforms collected traces into rich visualizations of operators, graphs, timelines, and hardware counter trends, exposing how dense inference, Mixture-of-Experts routing, and operator offloading behave in practice. With less than 4% runtime overhead and high profiling fidelity, our framework makes LLM inference both transparent and diagnosable, turning performance profiling into a practical tool for optimization, scheduling, and resource-aware deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8eeBPF\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5256\u6790LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u8fd0\u884c\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u76d1\u63a7", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7b97\u5b50\u7ea7\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u901f\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff08\u5982\u5185\u5b58\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff09", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u578b\u67cf\u514b\u83b1\u5c01\u5305\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff08eBPF\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6e90\u7801\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u6302\u8f7d\u63a2\u9488\u81f3\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u51fd\u6570\u5c42\uff0c\u5c06\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7b97\u5b50/\u56fe/\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf/\u786c\u4ef6\u6307\u6807\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0<4%\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5256\u6790\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63ed\u793a\u7a20\u5bc6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u53ca\u7b97\u5b50\u5378\u8f7d\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\u7279\u5f81", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u4f7fLLM\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u53ca\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5206\u6790\u624b\u6bb5"}}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by integrating external knowledge, yet retrieval models often miss relevant context, and generation models hallucinate with irrelevant data. We propose Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) for semantic representation and fine-grained retrieval of code and text. Our approach enhances retrieval precision through tree pruning and mitigates hallucinations via a re-ranking mechanism that integrates non-RAG solutions. Structuring external data into finer-grained nodes improves retrieval granularity. Evaluations on HumanEval and MBPP show up to 20% pass@1 accuracy gains and a 34% improvement over baselines on MBPP. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed PKG approach along with re-ranker effectively address complex problems while maintaining minimal negative impact on solutions that are already correct without RAG.
